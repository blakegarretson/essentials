<div id="content-box">
<h1>Welcome</h1>

Welcome to my carefully curated list of the best free Windows programs. 

This is the software that I find essential on a computer running Windows. These are the programs that I either immediately install when I setup a computer, or I end up installing as I need them.  In most instances I have tried a number of solutions before choosing one that I like the most, so I maintain this list for my own convenience so I can quickly remind myself of (and find) all of the software that I thought was best the last time I evaluated a category.

All of these programs are free for personal use, and most are open-source as well. If there are commercial versions available for a program, the free version listed here is not a time-limited trial, and it is useful without upgrading to a paid version.  In some cases I have listed alternatives, honorable mentions, or close seconds. Having said that, I try not to include redundant programs unless they bring something to the party.  And finally, you may think a certain application should go into a different category, and you would be right, but I had to make some arbitrary decisions since some software overlaps several categories.

I would love to get feedback if I'm missing a really great program that would enhance my quality of life and make me wonder how I ever lived without it.
