<h1 id="about-me-and-this-site">About me and this site…</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Blake. My degrees are in mechanical engineering, but I
have spent many years both professionally and recreationally crossing
over into the IT and computer science engineering realms when it
intersects with my interests and projects.</p>
<p>This list of software may not include your favorite software, but
alas, it is a reflection of my hobbies and proclivities. I like to
program, make music, create electronic devices, produce beautiful LaTeX
documents, create animations, write poetry and essays, read books of all
sorts, do math and statistics, and make other cool digital stuff amongst
dozens of other hobbies and interests. I find this list of software
useful, and I hope you do too. You may think a certain application
should go into a different category, and you probably would be right,
but I had to make some arbitrary decisions since some software overlaps
several categories.</p>
<p>You might ask, “why do you just have one huge list of programs on one
page instead of separate pages for each category?” The simple answer is
it’s more efficient for me to find what I want this way. If I’m looking
for the name of that screenshot app, I just hit CTRL-F and search for
“screenshot”. That’s really it. Also, I hate it when websites spread
content over a ton of pages for seemingly no reason (although the reason
is usually “ads”.)</p>
