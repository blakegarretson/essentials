# About me and this site...

Hey, what's up. My name is Blake Garretson. I'm a licensed professional engineer, although it's more complicated than that. My degrees are in mechanical engineering, I am currently working as a materials science R&D engineer, but I have spent many years both professionally and recreationally crossing over into the IT and computer science engineering realms when it intersects with my interests and projects.

This list of software may not include your favorite category of software, but alas, it is a reflection of my hobbies and proclivities. I like to program, make music, create electronic devices, produce beautiful LaTeX documents, create animations, write poetry and essays, read books of all sorts, do math and statistics, and make other cool digital stuff amongst dozens of other hobbies and interests. I find this list of software useful, and I hope you do too.

You might ask, "why do you just have one huge list of programs on one page instead of separate pages for each category?" The simple answer is it's more efficient for me to find what I want this way. If I'm looking for the name of that screenshot app, I just hit CTRL-F and search for "screenshot". That's really it. Also, I hate it when website spread content over a ton of pages for seemingly no reason (although the reason is usually "ads".)

And finally, you may think a certain application should go into a different category, and you probably would be right, but I had to make some arbitrary decisions since some software overlaps several categories.
