        <p><strong>Welcome to my carefully curated list of the best free
        programs for Windows, MacOS, and Linux!</strong></p>
        <p>This is the software that I find essential when working on a
        desktop or laptop. These are the programs that I either
        immediately install when I setup a new computer, or I end up
        installing as I need them. In most instances I have tried a
        number of solutions before choosing one that I like the most. I
        maintain this list for my own convenience so I can quickly
        remind myself of (and find) all of the software that I thought
        was best the last time I evaluated a category.</p>
        <p>Most of these programs are cross-platform, but if an app
        doesn’t support at least Windows and Mac I will make a note of
        that and usually list alternatives. All of these programs are
        free for personal use, and most are open-source as well. If
        there are commercial versions available for a program, the free
        version listed here is not a time-limited trial, and it is
        useful without upgrading to a paid version. In some cases I have
        listed alternatives, honorable mentions, or close seconds.
        Having said that, I try not to include redundant programs unless
        they bring something to the party. Likewise, I won’t bother
        listing software commonly included with the operating systems
        (e.g. Apple’s Music or Photos apps).</p>
        <p>Have a suggestion for a great program that should be on my
        list? Let me know about it! Have a comment or correction on
        something on this website? Click on the <a
        href="https://forms.gle/swSCivmLBwTxRwY27">Feedback</a> link and
        let me know!</p>
        <h1 id="images-video">Images &amp; Video</h1>
        <h2 id="video-player">Video Player</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a>:
        Cross-platform video player for nearly any format imaginable.
        Especially useful for when you need to do uncommon things like
        adjust audio/Bluetooth sync or load custom subtitles. The
        interface isn’t fancy, but it has the features you need and
        stays out of your way.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>While VLC works great on any platform, Mac users may prefer
        <a href="https://iina.io/">IINA</a>. It’s a full-fledged media
        player with a clean interface. <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-streaming-browser/id553245401?mt=12">Friendly
        Streaming Browser</a> is a weird name for a cool app. It’s just
        a front end for various streaming services (YouTube, Netflix,
        etc.), but it excels at multitasking by offering a
        Picture-In-Picture mode. I didn’t realized I needed this until I
        tried it. This is what you want when you’re working on something
        and need an easy way to play a 4-hour instrumental playlist from
        YouTube in the background, or maybe you’re editing photos or
        something and you want to watch a mindless episode of a cooking
        show in a tiny window at the corner of your screen.
        <strong>(Mac)</strong></p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="raster-photoimage-editor">Raster Photo/Image Editor</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>: Robust image
        editor similar to Photoshop. It might not be appropriate for a
        casual user who just wants to crop some photos, but it’s not
        really suited for DTP pros either since it’s missing native CMYK
        support. Having said that, if you’re doing non-print stuff, it
        will almost certainly get the job done if you have the patience
        to learn the tool. Bonus: the scripting allows for complex
        plugins and automation.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html">Paint.NET</a>
        is a fantastic alternative to GIMP for those weary of the
        learning curve (or the name). It is less powerful than GIMP, but
        it’s easy to use and really polished. It’s the Paint program
        Microsoft should have shipped with Windows.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="photo-managementviewing-and-casual-editing">Photo
        Management/Viewing (and Casual Editing)</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://x.photoscape.org/">Photoscape X</a>: Great
        program for photo viewing and basic touch-up. It makes it easy
        to do common tasks like cropping to standard sizes and removing
        red-eye. There is a Pro version with extra features, but the
        free version boasts a truly impressive feature set that is more
        than enough for most people. If you buy the Pro version it’s
        because you like it so much, not because you felt forced into it
        because the free version was so crippled.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="also-check-out">Also check out:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>If the Photoscape X workflow doesn’t agree with you, my
        runner up is <a
        href="https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/">XnView MP</a>. It has
        a somewhat old school interface with simple controls that may be
        more intuitive for some people. It has all the essential
        functions and more.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://www.faststone.org/FSViewerDetail.htm">FastStone
        Image Viewer</a> is a fantastic photo viewer with a truly
        impressive set of editing features. After Google retired their
        Picasa software I used FastStone for about a year, but I just
        couldn’t get on board with the (for me) unintuitive interface,
        and I ended up switching to something else. While it didn’t work
        out for me, it might be perfect for you.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong></p></li>
        <li><p>If all you need is a super-fast, image viewer (that
        incidentally has some robust editing features), look no further
        than <a href="https://www.irfanview.com/">IrfanView</a>. I
        started using it in the late 1990s, and it is still going
        strong. This is a great program to make your default action when
        clicking on JPEGs, GIFs, and PNGs.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong></p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="image-processingworkflow">Image Processing/Workflow</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.darktable.org/">darktable</a>: If
        you work with RAW photo files or want to get the most out of
        your photos, you need a non-destructive post-production software
        like darktable. This isn’t about “photoshopping” a picture;
        instead it’s all about histograms, levels, curves, sharpening,
        colors, lens correction, noise, etc.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.rawtherapee.com/">RawTherapee</a> is
        another app worth having in your toolbox. While darktable is
        overall the better option, RawTherapee has a few
        features/functions that I think are superior, so I like having
        both installed.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="vector-image-editor">Vector Image Editor</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a>: Really
        nice vector image editor for creating professional quality,
        scalable diagrams, logos, you-name-it. Its functionality rivals
        Adobe Illustrator, although sometimes the tools don’t map
        one-to-one.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If you only need a Mac solution to vector graphics, the
        excellent <a href="https://www.linearity.io/curve/">Curve</a>
        (formerly Vectornator) is hard to pass up. It’s one of those
        apps that looks so polished, it’s hard believe it’s free. It has
        all the essentials to make some incredible vector art.
        <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="artistic-image-editor">Artistic Image Editor</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>: Great digital
        painting software. It actually could replace Gimp for many use
        cases, and it supports CMYK.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Another cool option is Autodesk’s <a
        href="https://sketchbook.com/">Sketchbook</a>, which is now free
        (although you will need to create a free Autodesk ID to register
        it.) I just don’t want to invest the time in learning a program,
        saving a lot of files in their proprietary format, and then they
        yank the rug out. Autodesk has done that before, so I’m leery.
        Other than that, it’s great software… but so is Krita.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="stable-diffusion-ai-image-generation">Stable Diffusion
        AI Image Generation</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://drawthings.ai/">Draw Things</a> is the
        easiest to install and use AI image generator on Mac. One-click
        install, download a few models, and you’re in business. It
        handles inpainting/outpainting without the user even having to
        know what that means.  Having said that, the current state of AI
        means you have to know a bit of jargon and whatnot before you
        can really use this tool, but the toolset is robust, the in-app
        help is decent, and the results are excellent even running on a
        M1 Mac Mini.  AI is a rapidly changing landscape, and the
        developer is keeping up and adding impressive features at a fast
        pace. <strong>(Mac)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://diffusionbee.com/">Diffusion Bee</a> is the
        other “beginners” AI program that is easy to install. It isn’t
        as good as Draw Things at the moment, but it is certainly worth
        an honorable mention. There is a Windows version in the works,
        which will probably quickly make it the easiest way to run
        Stable Diffusion on Windows. <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI">ComfyUI</a> is
        probably the closest thing we have to a “one-click” install of
        Stable Diffusion on Windows so far. Just download it, extract
        the archive, and put your models in place. There are lots of web
        interfaces to Stable Diffusion, but many of them are harder to
        install and configure.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="screenshotsscreen-capture">Screenshots/Screen
        Capture</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://getsharex.com/">ShareX</a>: You don’t
        know how useful a good screenshot tool is until you start using
        it. It’s really handy to automatically save screenshots (or
        portions of screens) to a predetermined folder and keep it on
        the clipboard as well. ShareX takes it one step further and will
        upload the image to pretty much any site you like, and the OCR
        functionality is really cool. The icing on the cake is the
        screen capture capability that will let you record portions of
        your screen and save it to a GIF (or other formats). It’s great
        for playing tech support with family to show them how to do
        stuff. <strong>(Windows)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://getgreenshot.org/">Greenshot</a> was my
        old favorite, and you may want to use it if ShareX is confusing
        or seems like overkill.</p></li>
        <li><p>It’s worth noting that recent versions of Windows 10 now
        come with a tool called “Snip &amp; Sketch” that does something
        similar (use SHIFT + WINDOWS + S key combo to access it),
        although it doesn’t automatically save the image to a
        file.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://shottr.cc/">Shottr</a> is an amazing
        tool for screenshots on Mac. It has all the usual features plus
        cool stuff like scrolling captures (for long webpages) and OCR
        text recognition so you can cut and paste text from images on
        your screen. <strong>(Mac)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>If you don’t need/use anything beyond simple screenshots on
        Mac, it’s worth mentioning the SHIFT-CMD-4 shortcut gets you a
        portion of the screen and automatically saves the file to the
        desktop.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="live-streaming">Live Streaming</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>: While not
        exactly my jam, if you’re into live streaming OBS is a solid
        choice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="video-conversion">Video Conversion</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://handbrake.fr/">HandBrake</a>: Convert
        video from/to nearly any format. While incredibly powerful and
        complex, HandBrake makes it really simple to get started. If you
        don’t want anything special, just drag and drop a file, select a
        preset target format (e.g. Roku 1080p30 or Android 720p30), and
        hit start.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>On Windows if you want to convert your DVD library,
        you’ll need to put the <a
        href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/libdvdcss/1.2.11/win64/libdvdcss-2.dll">libdvdcss</a>
        library in the Handbrake directory.</p></li>
        <li><p>If Handbrake is too confusing and all you want to do is
        rip a DVD, <a href="http://www.makemkv.com/">MakeMKV</a> rips
        and decodes DVDs (even with copy protection). It just isn’t as
        versatile as Handbrake.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://sindresorhus.com/gifski">Gifski</a> is a
        super easy way to convert video to high-quality GIFs.
        <strong>(Mac)</strong></p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="video-editing">Video Editing</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.shotcut.org/">Shotcut</a> is a
        capable multi-track editor with a nice interface. If I don’t
        need anything special, this is the first place I reach.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://kdenlive.org/">kdenlive</a>: If you do
        need something special like key-framing, it’s great to have
        kdenlive in the toolbox. Shotcut has it beat in a few areas, so
        I still prefer it in general, but kdenlive has some features
        that make it worth having around.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/">DaVinci
        Resolve</a>: This is a professional package, but they have a
        free version that’s very impressive. It outshines the above
        editors in features, but I’m reluctant to learn a free tool that
        could be retracted at a whim, so in general the opensource tools
        above get my vote.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.openshot.org/">Openshot</a>: I’m
        listing this to remind myself to keep an eye on its development.
        Feature-wise, it seems like it falls right between Shotcut and
        kdevlive, but it feels pretty buggy yet. Having said that, it
        might scratch your itch, and it’s worth checking out along with
        the others.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="animation">Animation</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>: 3D
        modeling and animation. Has more power than I have skill, but
        other people do really cool things with it. It’s fun to play
        with though and is worth the download.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.synfig.org/">Synfig Studio</a>: Nice
        2D animation package. I dabble with projects, and when I do,
        this works for me. It’s simple and intuitive for the level of
        projects I make.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://opentoonz.github.io/e/">OpenToonz</a> is
        really cool 2D animation software that’s most well-known for
        being used by Studio Ghibli and Futurama. It is possible that
        OpenToonz is better than Synfig, but I don’t do enough animation
        to know the difference, and OpenToonz is less intuitive to
        me.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="media-server">Media Server</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://plex.tv/">Plex</a>: My reluctant choice
        for the best personal media server for most people. This is what
        you want for steaming your media to your Roku, Fire Stick, smart
        TV, etc. Just tell Plex where you store your movies, TV shows,
        and music and it will do the rest, including downloading cover
        art and show descriptions. My main reservation is they are
        monetizing the service more, and the free features feel sparse.
        For instance, you need a “Plex Pass” subscription to download
        shows to your client device for offline viewing. However,
        presently the core functionality is still free, and the easy
        setup and overall user experience is still worth giving Plex a
        try.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> is the more
        consumer-friendly, open-source alternative to Plex. Setup is
        fairly simple, although you may need to add some plugins to get
        all the functionality you want. Otherwise, it’s a fine
        alternative and arguably better than Plex in some regards. I
        would recommend trying Jellyfin first if you are more tech
        savvy. There are Jellyfin clients on every platform as well, so
        streaming to any device is easy.</p></li>

        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://getmusicbee.com/">MusicBee</a>: A great
        way to organize and play your local music library. Includes
        handy features like gapless playback and auto-tagging. An app
        like this is becoming less essential as I move to online
        services like Amazon Prime Music and Spotify, but when I do want
        to work with local music files, it’s hard to do better than
        MusicBee. <strong>(Windows)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>I’m not listing a Mac alternative for playback here because
        the default Apple Music app meets my meager needs.</li>

        <li><p><a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz
        Picard</a> is the best cross-platform solution for identifying
        and organizing a large collection of music files. It can figure
        out what files are based on tags and even audio fingerprints.
        Besides tagging it will rename and move files as well. Even if
        you’re using Apple Music or MusicBee to organize your music
        library, this is still a handy tool to clean up the incorrectly
        tagged files before adding them to your library.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If Picard isn’t to your liking, I would suggest <a
        href="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/">MP3Tag</a> . It is a universal
        batch tag editor that handles MP3s along with every other
        popular audio format. The robust file renaming/retagging tools
        and online database lookups make this powerful option for
        cleaning up your audio collection. This is only free for
        Windows. It’s a paid app on the Mac App Store.

        This used to be a commercial DAW that is now free as of 2018.
        It’s a rebranded version of SONAR Platinum, and it’s incredibly

        <li>Another great DAW is Waveform Free. While there is a Pro

        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://ardour.org/">Ardour</a> is worth
        checking out if you’re a Linux user. It does all the basics
        really well. From recording audio or MIDI, to editing, to
        mixing, you’re covered. The only trick is if you really want it
        for free, you should use your distribution’s packager manager
        and don’t download it from the website.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>You may be asking why I limit my Ardour recommendation to
        Linux users. The simple answer is on Windows and Mac it isn’t
        really “free”. While it is open source and you can build it from
        scratch for free, if you want a convenient, pre-built binary,
        you need to either buy it or pay a subscription. The free/demo
        version goes silent after 10 minutes, which I consider too
        restrictive to still include here on my list of free software.
        Having said all that, it might be worth your money, so check it

        MIDI control system which can power an entire home studio”. I’d
        call it a nice step sequencer with VST and SoundFont support for
        creating music. I wouldn’t call it a DAW because it doesn’t
        record multitrack audio, but combined with Audacity, you can
        make some cool stuff. Honestly, I wouldn’t even list LMMS now
        that Cakewalk is free, except LMMS is opensource, and Cakewalk

        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is
        easy to recommend for general text editing and quick file edits
        on Windows simply because it is blazing fast and the interface
        stays out of your way. This is my default application for text
        files, and over the years I’ve written many thousands of lines
        of code in Notepad++. Having said that, the antiquated syntax
        coloring system and somewhat clunky customization limits how
        well it scales to many tasks. But it is still a fast editor and
        it shines when opening a 1 GB log file… as long as it doesn’t
        need to be syntax colored as well.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://coteditor.com/">CotEditor</a> is my
        favorite text editor on a Mac for quick and easy text editing.
        It isn’t as well known as other editors, but it is fast. It
        isn’t trying to be an IDE, so don’t expect too much, but the
        amount of customization and the total feature set is fantastic.
        It has an inspired and flexible scripting interface which lets
        you write plugins in Python, bash, Applescript, and several
        other languages. And did I mention it was fast?? This is a great
        choice for your default text file handler.
        <strong>(Mac)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>If CotEditor is too barebones for you, the next step up
        without going to an IDE is <a
        href="https://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> . It opens slower
        than CotEditor, but it has some robust functionality including
        an impressive array of text manipulation tools and extensive
        language support with syntax highlighting, while still staying
        fairly lightweight. <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>: <code>vi</code>
        was a legendary, powerful keyboard-based text editor with a
        steep learning curve, Vim is its most successful clone (itself
        being a derivative of Stevie), and Neovim aims at pushing Vim
        into the 21st century with a clean code base and features like
        Lua extensibility and asynchronous plugins which allow for
        things like async linters. Some people think it’s silly to use a
        <code>vi</code> clone more than four decades after it was
        introduced, but there are some tasks that are orders of
        magnitude faster in a <code>vi</code> clone than modern
        mouse-oriented text editors.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If a console-based text editor is what you need and you
        don’t love the <code>vi</code> modal editing and key bindings,
        you should really check out <a
        href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a>. Micro works
        from a console, but it has modern capabilities like mouse
        support, multiple cursors, Lua plugins, tabs, tmux-like splits,
        and syntax color schemes. Best of all, the normal Windows key
        bindings like CTRL-C, CTRL-V, CTRL-S, and CTRL-Z work as
        expected.</li>

        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>
        is a fast, clean, good looking editor, and it gets points for
        popularizing (if not actually inventing) the command palette and
        document map (and maybe even multiple cursors?), but I want to
        like it more than I actually do. Maybe I’m just too old to learn
        new key bindings? You should check it out though. Sublime is
        truly excellent software. The real reason it’s just an honorable
        mention is it technically doesn’t meet my criteria for this
        website as “free”. You can evaluate Sublime Text for free with
        no feature limitations or time limits, but you should pay if you
        continue to use it.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a> is a
        jack-of-all-trades that is good at everything, but not
        best-in-class in anything. It is a versatile cross-platform
        programmer’s text editor that you can configure to be anything
        from a simple Notepad.exe replacement to an ultra-lightweight
        IDE. It’s just hard to recommend because while it’s good for
        quick edits and opening text files, Notepad++ or TextMate are
        even faster for those quick tasks. And while Geany is really
        nice for light coding, VS Code is even better. Geany is rarely
        the best tool for the job, but it might be the right choice for
        a computer that just needs an all-purpose, do-it-all editor. If
        you do try it, there are lots of great features hidden in the
        official plugin package, so be sure to grab it as well.</p></li>

        <h2 id="programming-editoride">Programming Editor/IDE</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio
        Code</a>: VS Code is a legitimately great editor for just about
        any language. From linter to debugging, everything you need can
        be integrated into a seamless workflow. Check out the extensions
        to add nearly any functionality you could want, turning VS Code
        into a legitimate IDE. A huge bonus is the excellent Jupyter
        Notebook support. For many use cases, there’s no reason to run a
        standalone Jupyter server anymore.  (Note: Don’t confuse VS Code
        with <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual
        Studio</a> which is a full-blown IDE with more advanced features
        that I don’t find necessary for the hobbyist.)</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Two things worth mentioning: First, you can run VS Code
        directly in a web browser <a
        href="https://vscode.dev/">here</a>. The experience is pretty
        incredible all things considered. Second, VS Code is very
        actively developed, so if you want the latest and greatest, you
        may want to run VS Code Insiders. On paper it is a beta version
        of VS Code where the new features are tested out, except I have
        found Insiders to be stable enough for production work. I
        honestly haven’t noticed a difference in reliability.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a> is another code editor
        that I’m keeping my eye on. It is a newer offering, but it’s
        already doing some cool things, and it seems to be faster than
        VS Code for those quick code edits. It still has a way to go to
        be competitive with VS Code, but I like where it’s
        going.</p></li>

        writing prose, it’s hard to beat this distraction-free text
        editor. It has Markdown support and other handy features that
        push it to the front of the pack for its genre. Version 2 is
        Windows-only. <strong>(Windows)</strong></p>

        <li><p><a
        href="https://gottcode.org/focuswriter/">FocusWriter</a>: If the
        command palette interface of WriteMonkey 3 is a deal-breaker for
        you, a good runner-up is FocusWriter. It has a more classic
        distraction-free interface, and it has plenty of convenience
        features like smart quote conversion.  ( Windows/Linux)</p></li>

        <li><p><a
        href="https://desairem.com/wordpress/ufocus/">uFocus</a> is a

        though it is simple, there are plenty of customization options
        to make it work and look just like you want it to. It’s a
        wonderful app. <strong>(Mac)</strong></p></li>

        <h2 id="text-utility">Text Utility</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://boop.okat.best/">Boop</a> is a text
        scratchpad that provides a large host of text manipulations
        useful for programming or writing. You paste in your text, and
        then run a script on it. It can be anything you can think of,
        like running it through ROT13, trimming whitespace, hashing it,
        html encode/decode, sorting, removing duplicate lines,
        converting cases, or tons of other operations. If you don’t see
        what you need, you can create your own script or download

        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>: A distributed
        version control system that quickly took over the open source
        world, and with good reason. If you’re a programmer, you already
        know what this is. On Windows a big bonus is the installer
        includes all the Unix command-line tools you know and love. If
        you need ls, cat, grep, awk, and all the rest, I think this is
        the easiest way to add them to your Windows system.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://gitextensions.github.io/">Git
        Extensions</a>: Sometimes a GUI is convenient to visualize
        branches and handle more complicated tasks when when you don’t
        feel like looking up the correct commands/switches, and I think
        Git Extensions is far superior to the official Git GUI. I wish
        it was cross-platform, but the latest versions are built on .NET
        and Windows only. <strong>(Windows)</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://github.com/Murmele/Gittyup">Gittyup</a>
        is a good cross-platform option for a Git GUI. On Mac there are
        less options for a good GUI that isn’t proprietary, but this
        works well for me. It makes complex Git operations more
        manageable.</p></li>

        Git.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a>: WinMerge has
        been around for a long time, and it’s still one of the best
        all-around solutions. I’m listing it here because I like it
        better than Meld for directory comparison, and for that task

        incredible tool for mathematical or scientific computing of any
        kind. The lightweight syntax is a delight even by Python
        standards, and its speed usually matches or beats compiled
        languages due to its JIT compiler and language design. Julia is
        made for speed (both in writing and execution), and I think it
        combines the best of Python, Fortran, MATLAB, and R. I use it
        more as a math tool than a general purpose scripting language,
        hence this separate category.</p>

        <p><em>Below are a few excellent fonts suitable for programming,
        consoles, terminal windows, PuTTY, etc. While just one font
        should be sufficient, I typically have all of these installed as
        one font may look better in a certain terminal or editor, at a
        particular size or scaling, or on a particular monitor.</em></p>

        <li><p><a
        href="http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/">Dina</a>:
        Great bitmap font in 6, 8, 9, and 10 points with normal, bold,
        italic, and bold/italic faces. I like the 8 and 10 especially
        well. Dina is so clear and crisp on even the worst monitors that
        it is actually pleasurable to read. It’s not really necessary on
        a decent monitor though.</p></li>

        quickly. Perfect for when the fonts below can be
        overkill.</p></li>

        flexible font system that lets you customize letters (a/g/i/l/0)

        from 7 weights and 4 widths, and sans, serif, and mono variants.
        There are 168 styles in all, so you will find one that works for
        any given situation.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/">Iosevka</a>:
        Similar to the Input font, Iosevka raises the bar by adding
        ligatures, more weights, more variants, and incredible character
        coverage with thousands and thousands of supported glyphs. There
        are plenty of variants with different character and symbol
        styles, so you should be able to find one that has the look you
        want. There are so many choices it can be confusing, but if want
        a general purpose font that works everywhere (but doesn’t have
        ligatures), start with the “Iosevka Fixed” font. At the end of
        the day, this is the only font I need because I can configure it
        to look any way I want.</p></li>

        <h2 id="office-suite">Office Suite</h2>

        Provides all the usual “office” suspects, like a word processor,
        spreadsheet, and presentation applications. While still lacking
        the polish of MS Office, for most use cases this is a reasonable
        replacement. The key functionality is there, and the major gaps
        of the early releases (e.g. Goal Seek and Pivot Tables) have
        long since been filled. Worth noting: LibreOffice Draw works
        well for flowcharts (similar to Visio).</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Full disclosure, I don’t find LibreOffice essential in the
        sense that I use it often. I like LibreOffice as a convenience
        so I can easily open an MS Office file or perform the odd task,
        but I actually far prefer working in the cloud with Google Docs
        and Sheets. In some ways, Sheets is even better than Excel or
        LibreOffice Calc with conveniences like the split()
        function.</li>

        <h2 id="note-taking">Note-Taking</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.onenote.com/download">OneNote</a> is
        easy to recommend given the comprehensive functionality and the
        fact that it is free. For many tasks, I’m a plain text file guy,
        and I think note-taking apps are sometimes unnecessary when a
        simple text editor works fine. However, I use OneNote at work
        extensively, and I really like it. I can integrate emails,
        pictures, tables, and all the rest into a workflow organized by
        notebooks, sections, and pages. However, if you don’t use Office
        365 and/or Outlook, OneNote might not have as many advantages
        for you.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is where you
        might want to go if you want good Markdown support and you don’t
        need total inoperability on mobile devices. The Canvas feature
        is really cool. It lets you visualize and connect data in
        interesting ways, a bit like a mind mapper. Obsidian’s biggest
        shortcoming is you have to figure out your own file-sync
        solution unless you pay them for their sync service. Saving your
        vaults to Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, etc. will solve this
        for you, but you still won’t be able to work with some
        combinations (like saving a vault to Google Drive on desktop and
        opening it on an iPhone). Likewise, there was limited Canvas
        support for mobile (at least initially), so you could create a
        note on desktop that you couldn’t open on mobile. That isn’t
        true anymore, but be aware there isn’t complete parity between
        desktop and mobile.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If Obsidian is too unwieldy for you, <a
        href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a> is a nice… um,
        simple note app that works across all platforms. This is a good
        choice if you don’t need multimedia integrated into your notes,
        and you want to access your notes anywhere. It supports Markdown
        and tagging, but otherwise it’s barebones. It does make syncing
        automatic though, and that’s the real selling point. If you use
        multiple platforms regularly, this is a great experience. You
        can jump from MacOS to Android to Windows to iOS to anything
        with a web browser without missing a beat, and the interface
        stays out of your way.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://tot.rocks/">Tot</a> is a Mac-only app
        that sits in your menubar waiting to save quick notes and
        snippets of text. This is not a general purpose notes app like
        the above apps. It is very limited, and it just has seven
        Markdown-supported “pages” of notes where you can type or paste
        whatever you like. This weird limitation carves out a unique
        use-case that I didn’t know I needed until I started using it.
        As a bonus, syncing is automatic and seamless, so if you install
        Tot on a laptop and desktop (for instance), it serves as a
        common clipboard where you can pass information.

        favorite notes app for personal use, but I can’t quite
        officially include it on my list because the free version is
        limited to 50 notes, which is just too limited to qualify for
        the spirit of this site. HOWEVER, it is the perfect compromise

        style calculator with all the basic functionality along with
        unit conversions, and other handy operations, but it also
        enables real-time collaboration. This app really scales well
        because it works equally well as a simple scratchpad or in a
        more complicated scenario with calculation templates containing
        variables and lots of dependent calculations. The best feature
        is the cloud syncing so you can open it on any platform and your
        calculations are all there. There are native apps for Windows
        and Mac, but you can use the web version on Linux or any mobile
        device.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.speedcrunch.org/">SpeedCrunch</a> is
        a decent alternative for a calculator with fast start-up and
        plenty of functionality. The interface is deceptively simple,
        but lurking under the hood are constants, variables, an
        impressive list of math functions, and equation support.
        Unfortunately, while SpeedCrunch is cross-platform, it looks
        fuzzy/blurry on Mac. The graphics toolkit doesn’t seem to
        upscale well on hi-res monitors, so I just don’t use it on
        Mac.</p></li>
        <li><p>For a non-cloud Mac solution, <a
        href="https://numi.app/">Numi</a> is the best free alternative.
        The paid version supports multiple pages/notebooks, but the free
        version has full functionality otherwise. Intuitive calculations
        (e.g. “5% of 20”) and unit conversion (although somewhat basic)
        make Numi a solid desktop calculator.

        a good place to start if you want a scientific calculator on
        Windows or Linux. It can do everything from integration to
        units. The interface is not my favorite, but it is packed with
        features. (Technically this works on Mac too, but with no .app
        or installer, you have to use Homebrew or MacPorts, and there
        isn’t even a shortcut/icon for it, so the experience is
        subpar.)</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://ncalc-app.web.app/">NCalc</a>: A robust
        scientific calculator for Mac. This has pretty much everything
        you would commonly need in a calculator. There is a Pro upgrade
        that unlocks graphing and other bells and whistles, but it is
        still useful without the upgrade. I actually did end up buying
        the lifetime license for $3.99, which is worth it to me.

        an app suite you might want to check out if you need a graphing
        calculator. This suite is five calculators in one, including
        modules for graphing, geometry, algebra, and probability. The
        graphing is fairly robust and the customization is impressive
        for what it is. It’s really great for high school level math or

        what you need if you are looking for a flexible, powerful unit
        conversion solution. It really shines at combining fundamental
        units to build more complex units. The interface is a strong
        point. Instead of scrolling through long lists of supported
        units, you can just start typing and the list is automatically
        filtered. <strong>(Windows, Linux)</strong></p></li>

        generic), but it has the units I need as an engineer that other
        apps don’t. The interface is as spartan as you can get, but it
        really is quite powerful. Be sure to read the help because there
        is some hidden (or at least non-obvious) functionality like
        “favorites”, simple math evaluation, and time conversion.

        Matplotlib and Seaborn (see <a

        quickly without having to know the commands. This venerable GNU
        program has been around since the 1980s quietly excelling in its
        domain. If something can be plotted at all, it can probably be
        plotted by gnuplot. You might want to start with the demo

        box plots to polar plots, Veusz has you covered. The main
        selling point for me is that you have total control of
        everything you see on the graph: colors, lines, fonts, you name
        it. You should be able to get exactly what you want. There are
        some downsides, most notably: strange handling of error bars,
        lackluster data manipulation, and the histogram functionality
        could be more robust.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://labplot.kde.org/">LabPlot</a> is
        fantastic software for XY plots, although it does excellent
        histograms as well. It is incredibly customizable, but be aware
        it takes some exploration to really figure out everything it can
        do (which is a LOT). You can make some incredible looking plots
        that would look at home in even the prettiest info-graphics.
        There are plot “themes” which make it easy to quickly try out
        some different looks. Labplot will definitely produce something
        that doesn’t look like just another Excel plot. Other notable
        features include impressive data manipulation, interactive
        plots, XY plot digitizer, as well as robust curve
        fitting.</p></li>

        replace commercial software like Mathematica, Maple, and Matlab,
        and it has advanced enough that it really does make those
        packages unnecessary for many use cases. Sage brings some of the
        best tools in the open-source world together under one interface
        to create an incredibly powerful package that’s useful to nearly
        every STEM field. The main problem with Sage is the complete
        absence of a user interface. The novice is presented with an
        empty prompt, and is expected to know what to type. It could
        really benefit from a cohesive graphical interface that guides
        the user a little better (like wxMaxima or the commercial
        options).</p></li>

        Symbolic computer algebra system with robust plotting. Be sure
        to use the bundled app called wxMaxima, which is an easy-to-use
        graphical interface that wraps the Maxima backend. Given that
        SageMath has Maxima built in, this standalone version may seem
        redundant, but novices will find wxMaxima easier to jump into
        and start using right away.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>An alternative to a standalone app like Maxima for simple
        symbolic algebra is <a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a>,
        which technically isn’t an application, but rather a Python
        library. If you use Sympy in a Jupyter notebook inside VS Code,
        you have a pretty incredible environment for CAS. This is
        actually my preferred solution, but you need to be fluent in
        Python for this to be viable.</li>

        a MATLAB clone, so porting programs is fairly trivial. The use
        cases of a program like this (for me) are pretty narrow these
        days given the accessibility and capabilities of programming
        languages like Julia and Python (along with libraries like Scipy
        and Numpy), and the advancement of more broad-purpose software
        like SageMath. Octave is still immensely powerful though, and a
        great environment for mathematical exploration, so I’m leaving
        it on my list. Also note that SageMath has an Octave interface,
        so if you have it in your path, you can call Octave functions
        directly from Sage.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The obvious runner-up here for numerical computation is <a

        history as a capable numerical analysis package and has always
        had significant overlap in functionality with Octave (and MATLAB
        for that matter). You may like Scilab better for some reason, so
        if you’re serious about math you should check it out, but the
        Octave community is more active and there are more libraries
        available for Octave, so I’d still start there.</li>

        later. This is a front end for scientific computing languages
        like Python, R, and Julia that is perfect for interactive
        exploration. I could have easily listed this under the
        Programming category, but Jupyter is really more of a scientific
        computing platform than a programming environment.  This is
        where you do math or data science, explore statistics, and
        slice, dice, and manipulate data before analysis and
        visualization.</p>

        great package for quickly analyzing some data and making
        decent-looking stats plots with very little effort. If I want
        simple descriptive statistics, a histogram, or a quick t-test,
        Jamovi makes it easy (although honestly, if I need much more
        than that I’m probably in Jupyter using Python with libraries
        like Pandas to help slice and dice the data.) Jamovi looks very
        polished, and the core functionality is there, but I wish there
        were more customization options for the graphs and more data
        manipulation tools. Also, it’s worth noting that Jamovi is one
        of the many front-ends for R, the 800-pound-gorilla of stats
        packages, so there are a number of modules available to add
        functionality. Jamovi is under very active development, and new
        releases come out at least monthly, so I’m excited to see what’s
        coming in the future.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://jasp-stats.org/">JASP</a> looks very
        similar to Jamovi, and in fact, at first glance the interfaces
        appear to be near clones. While I find Jamovi just plain better
        in a number of ways, I’m keeping my eye on JASP because it
        appears to be under active development as well, and JASP
        supports some analyses that Jamovi doesn’t while still offering
        an easy-to-use interface.</p></li>
        <li><p>On paper, <a
        href="https://www.blueskystatistics.com/">BlueSky Statistics</a>
        should be the easy winner in this category. It has many, many
        more features than Jamovi. However, I don’t find the interface
        as intuitive for casual analysis, and by default the plots look
        fairly bad. The plots can certainly be tweaked through the R
        language, but it isn’t transparent to the casual user. Besides
        the impressive collection of analysis methods, the real reason I
        might reach for BlueSky instead of Jamovi is the robust set of
        data manipulation tools.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/resources/past/">PAST</a>
        is the only app in this category that isn’t just a front-end for
        R. If you look past the deceptively plain interface, this is a
        super powerful stats program chock-full of functionality.
        There’s no safety net or hand-holding to help you interpret the
        results, but it has an amazing manual describing the equations
        used and even includes extensive citations, so this is no black
        box. It has a very robust set of statistical plotting tools, and
        the histograms are actually pretty good with a fair amount of
        customization (including overlaying a normal

        Fusion 360</a>: I hate to rely on proprietary software that
        might be pulled behind a paywall tomorrow, but Fusion 360 is a
        professional-grade 3D modeler that can’t be passed up when
        they’re giving it away for free. Professionally, I’ve used
        everything from Pro/E to Catia to I-DEAS to NX to Inventor and a
        half dozen more CAD packages, and Fusion 360 is as good as any
        of them for creating 3D models. The interface is incredibly
        intuitive if you’ve used any real CAD package before. I use
        Fusion on both Windows and Mac and switching between platforms
        is seamless. If you sign up as a hobbyist (i.e. not for
        commercial use) you can get a free license. They recently
        further crippled the free version (e.g. file format support and
        number of active documents allowed), but it’s still very
        usable.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If the Fusion 360 restrictions are non-starters for you,
        here are three free (and open source) CAD alternatives worth
        trying:</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="section-1"></h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>: Fairly
        full-featured 2D/3D parametric CAD modeler. This is the only
        open source CAD program that looks and functions even remotely
        like a real, commercial CAD program, and it’s capabilities are
        pretty amazing for what it is, but it’s still painful for me to
        use compared to any good commercial product. The interface can
        be clunky and seems to work against me at every step, and for
        some tasks I just can’t figure out an efficient workflow (or
        can’t figure out how to accomplish it at all). Having said that,
        there is a lot of great functionality here, including a good
        constraint manager and a decent CAM module that generates very
        usable G-code.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://librecad.org/">LIbreCAD</a> is worth
        looking at if you want to make 2D prints. While FreeCAD has a
        robust 2D sketcher, its focus isn’t 2D prints. That’s where
        LibreCAD can often outshine FreeCAD, although I wish it was
        parametric. At the end of the day, I can make a perfectly
        serviceable print with LibreCAD, but it feels like it should
        have been easier to get there. But for free? It’s not bad. I
        have done some paid side jobs with it, and it did what I needed
        it to do.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="http://solvespace.com/index.pl">Solvespace</a>
        is such a tiny, fast, quirky, unique, and capable program, I had
        to mention it. Don’t let the retro look fool you. This is a
        powerful 2D/3D parametric modeler with a legit constraint
        solver. Besides FreeCAD, that is a very rare find in free CAD
        software. This interface is nothing like a standard CAD package,
        but if you are into making 3D objects for 3D printing, this
        program is great. For normal use, I think the glaring omission
        in its feature set is a tool for adding fillets/rounds. That’s a
        deal breaker for me.</p></li>

        than I would like for doing simple schematics, but it’s worth
        learning.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.tinycad.net/">TinyCAD</a> is a good
        alternative to KiCad if you do circuit design. I don’t know that
        it can do anything that KiCad can’t, but I think it is easier to
        use in some ways and I find it better for some jobs. It’s chief
        short-coming is it’s Windows -only.

        It’s like the Notepad.exe or Windows Paint of the schematics
        world. Not very glamorous or loaded with features, but it works
        in a pinch. (By the way, when you click on the ExpressSCH link,
        you’ll want to download ExpressPCB Classic and you’ll get

        Cura</a>: Cura is a great slicer that works with any printer
        (not just Ultimakers). I think it’s the most user-friendly
        slicer out there, especially for those new to 3D printing. It
        has plenty of features without overwhelming the user, but most
        importantly, the defaults are all good enough to slice your
        first model without fiddling with parameters or knowing too
        much.</p>
        <ul>

        shocking how many terrible GPX editors are out there, and JOSM
        stands out as a truly capable package in comparison, even if it

        QGIS and JOSM for sure, but they really do different things, so
        it’s worth having both in your toolbox if you are into maps. My
        favorite function in QGIS is the Georeferencer tool which lets
        you map a raster image map onto actual coordinates. This is
        handy for doing things like superimposing a scanned trail map
        onto a topo map. Speaking of which, QGIS also supports GeoPDF

        monetize the software. You would try to install FileZilla, and
        the next thing you knew you had McAfee installed too. Since
        then, they aren’t bundling bloatware with FileZilla anymore, and
        they are offering a Pro version with extra features instead. I

        the features are all there. If you need a standalone BitTorrent
        client, this is a great place to start.</p></li>

        Remote GUI</a> is the perfect companion to <a
        href="https://transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> . This is
        really the best choice for when you want to remote control a
        Transmission session running on a server. This is handy if you
        have a torrent box and you just want to add/monitor torrents
        from another computer. So to be clear, you would need to run
        Transmission on the server/torrent box and Transmission Remote
        GUI runs on your desktop/laptop.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="https://github.com/tympanix/Electorrent">Electorrent</a>
        is the a great alternative when you want a nice, clean-looking
        client with a modern UI to manage your torrents remotely. It
        isn’t overly complicated, it supports all the popular torrent
        backends, and it has all the usual functionality that you want
        without overwhelming you with options.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://soduto.com/">Soduto</a> makes it easier
        to for your Mac to interact with your Linux and Android devices.
        Similar to AirDrop, you can share files between systems, but you
        can also share clipboards and even send SMS messages from your
        Mac through your Android phone. <strong>(Mac)</strong></p></li>

        Desktop</a>: For the simplicity, it’s hard to beat this solution
        to remote access and support. It makes it easy to check
        something on my desktop computer while I’m away from the house,
        and it’s also handy if you are the “IT Guy” for your friends and
        family. They can set this up pretty easily and share their
        screen with you so you can fix their issue.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If you aren’t a Chrome user, you may prefer <a
        href="https://www.teamviewer.com/">Teamviewer</a> . It is
        similar in that it makes it easy for non-techy people to add
        remote control. I can send them a download link, they install
        it, and tell me the ID and password that is displayed in the app
        so I can connect. That’s it. No other configuration is
        needed.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://www.uvnc.com/downloads/ultravnc.html">UltraVNC</a>:
        If you need full-blown, full-featured remote desktop control,
        UltraVNC will do the job fine. I just don’t find myself using
        VNC as much as I used to as I move more functions to the cloud
        and rely less on my own desktops. This is a more cumbersome
        solution because it requires port-forwarding and either a static
        IP or a dynamic DNS solution to make it useful outside of your
        home network. <strong>(Windows)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>I’m not listing a VNC client for Mac because it has a VNC

        apparent successor to Skype and Teamspeak in many communities,
        especially in the gaming world. I have no particular affinity to
        the app itself, but it works fine on both desktop and mobile,
        and there are some cool communities that made their home on
        Discord.  Of particular note is that Discord is also becoming
        the “new IRC” for many programming communities. The IRC channels

        really don’t need another chat protocol in my life, but Telegram
        is doing some things right like real cross-platform support/sync
        and no size restrictions when sharing media or documents. It’s a
        very polished experience, and features like group voice chat
        work exceptionally well.</p></li>
        <li><p>If privacy or security is paramount to you, then <a
        href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> has Telegram beat. In
        Telegram, end-to-end encryption is only optional, and you can’t
        encrypt group chats. Signal fixes those shortcomings, but falls
        short of Telegram in other areas.</p></li>

        <h2 id="ipport-scanner">IP/Port Scanner</h2>
        <ul>

        cross-platform solution I reach for when I need to find out
        what’s on my local network. You get IPs, hostnames, open ports,
        MACs, vendors, and more. The default settings out of the box
        aren’t great for my uses, but I can configure it to be exactly
        what I need. For instance, some of the results are hidden by
        default, so I configure the “fetchers” to include vendors, and I
        like to hide all the IPs except the ones that respond to ping,
        and I scan more ports (like 445, 20-23).</li>

        <li><p><a
        href="http://docfetcher.sourceforge.net/">DocFetcher</a> is the
        search tool you need if you want to search file contents. You
        choose the folders you want to index, and a low-resource process
        watches for changes in real time.  Searching for filenames or
        contents works just as expected. Windows search is terrible, and
        there’s no perfect alternative, but DocFet cher is pretty
        close.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.voidtools.com/">Everything</a>: If
        you just want to search filenames, Everything is your best bet.
        It supports wildcards, boolean operations, exact cases/phrases,
        and regular expressions. Just type a filename, and you’ll get
        immediate results from all your drives instantly. If you want to
        search network drives, you will need to go to Options and add
        them to your search folders under Indexing. You can also search
        file contents, although that will take much longer because it
        doesn’t support (or require) indexing.

        <h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
        <ul>

        <strong>(Windows)</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.keka.io/en/">Keka</a> is easy to
        recommend because it does more than Mac’s built-in Archive
        Utility by supporting more formats and adding compression with
        encryption. It’s free from the website, or a paid app on the
        AppStore. <strong>(Mac)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>If you don’t need fancy compression options, and you just
        want something that will automatically decompress just about
        every format you’ve probably ever heard of, you may prefer <a
        href="https://theunarchiver.com/">The Unarchiver</a>. The
        interface is non-existent. You just click on an archive in
        Finder to decompress it. <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://peazip.github.io/">PeaZip</a> is worth a
        look if 7-zip doesn’t work for you because you’ve encountered
        some obscure format, or if you’re on Mac or Linux. It supports
        basically every format that you would conceivably (or
        inconceivably) run into. The interface doesn’t look native
        (especially on Mac), but it is very usable and great for
        previewing an archive before decompressing it.</p></li>

        Imaging/Formatting/Repair</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">balena Etcher</a>: A
        nice clean, easy-to-use program to write disk images to flash
        devices (USB drives, microSD cards, etc.). This is great for
        putting Linux distros on bootable USB drives or setting up a
        microSD card for a Raspberry Pi.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Runner up goes to <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a>. It
        gives you more options than Etcher at the cost of some added
        complexity. I have also run across some images where Rufus works
        where Etcher fails, so it’s handy to have Rufus around even if I
        use Etcher most of the time. <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.ventoy.net/">Ventoy</a> serves the
        same purpose as a traditional disk imager, although it adds more
        flexibility and functions quite differently. You install Ventoy
        onto a USB drive via the handy Windows installer, and then you
        can drop as many bootable disk images (ISO, IMG, etc.) as you
        like onto the drive. When you boot to the USB drive, Ventoy will
        give you a menu to let you choose which image to boot. Super
        handy way of carrying several OSes in your pocket, all on a
        single drive. <strong>(Windows, Linux)</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree">Macrium
        Reflect Free</a>: Great for making disk images or transitioning

        Partition Master</a>: The Windows 10 disk management tools are
        limited in functionality, and sooner or later you may need a
        tool like this to fix/partition/format a drive. My most common
        use case is recovering all the space on a USB drive that has a
        Linux image on it, perhaps with multiple partitions, one of
        which is the EFI boot partition. The Windows Disk Management
        tools might let you delete some (but not all) partitions, while
        the free version of Partition Master will have you back in
        business in seconds. It also resizes partitions and clones
        disks, but the free version won’t create an image of a live OS
        like Macrium Reflect Free, hence I still have both listed here.

        Memory Card Formatter</a> may be a simpler solution if all you
        need is to fix an SD card. Some devices can be finicky about the
        format of SD/microSD cards, and this official application from
        the SD Association has fixed some obscure issues I’ve had in the
        past. This is especially true of SDHC/SDXC cards since Windows
        10 seems to like formatting higher capacity cards as NTFS

        it’s confusing why this is different than something like
        FreeFileSync, Syncthing shines at realtime continuous
        synchronization while FreeFileSync is geared towards a file
        backup that runs (for instance) once a day. The big bonus is
        Syncthing’s Android app, allowing you to sync files between your
        computer and your phone, but the lack of an iOS app is a serious
        problem for me.</p></li>

        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/">winget</a>:
        If you wish you had Linux-like package management on Windows
        (e.g. apt, yum, or pacman), winget has you covered. Microsoft’s
        new package manager isn’t exactly well-advertised, but it works
        well and the list of supported packages is growing. On a recent
        Windows build, you probably already have it installed. The best
        feature is that it works with existing programs whether they
        were installed with winget or not. It integrates with the
        Windows “Apps and Features” interface in Settings (or the older
        “Programs and Features” in Control Panel) so it knows what you
        have installed. It isn’t perfect though. Sometimes it can be
        frustrating working with packages with the same or similar
        names, or multiple versions of the same package. There’s room
        for improvement, but I still think it works better than
        Chocolatey (see below).</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://scoop.sh/">Scoop</a> is a command line
        package manager focusing on non-GUI tools to make Linux users
        feel at home on Windows. For instance, need to quickly install
        nmap or curl? Scoop is a great way to do that. There is also an
        “extra” bucket (i.e. repo) of tools that includes GUI apps and
        other tools that don’t fit into the main inclusion criteria for
        scoop. The real selling point here is that it installs
        everything in your home directory (or other specified location),
        so you don’t need admin privileges and you won’t see UAC prompts
        every time you add or remove a program. Scoop may look redundant
        to winget, but it works differently enough that it is the better
        choice for certain situations. For me, Scoop is essential if
        you’re stuck on a company computer without admin
        rights.</p></li>

        manager, but you do want up to date programs, this is a good
        option. It scans your installed programs, shows you which ones
        have available updates, and then it helps update them. It
        supports a decent selection of popular software, although it
        isn’t going to cover every app on your computer. This is great
        for casual users.</p>

        <li><p>Not long ago <a
        href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> was probably the
        most well-known solution to package management on Windows. It
        may still be a better choice for some people as it has broad
        package support. It supports thousands of packages, and the vast
        majority of the software listed on Blake’s Essentials can be
        found there. Having said that, I wish it were more robust. I’ve
        had plenty of headaches where Chocolatey wouldn’t let me
        uninstall software or I had weird conflicts from multiple
        versions of packages that I couldn’t remedy. I switched to
        winget largely because of these issues.</p></li>
        <li><p>I’m guessing the most popular graphical package manager
        out there is <a href="https://ninite.com/">Ninite</a> . It’s
        great software, it’s easy to use, but it just doesn’t include
        enough packages to really be a full-fledged package manager. If
        Ninite supports all the packages you want, you might want to try
        it first. Personally, I see Ninite as something I can use on my
        parents’ computer to keep their software up to date.</p></li>

        a lot of options out there in this category, but I like
        Bleachbit because it’s completely free and open-source, so at
        least you know what it’s trying to do under the hood. Be aware
        that it is highly debated whether you should even use a program
        like this on Windows since Windows has it’s own tools to clean
        up after itself, and mucking about in the registry can cause
        problems you didn’t ask for.</p>

        main advantage it has over Bleachbit is the ability to fix a
        plethora of registry issues. (Again, maybe it’s better to let it

        press caps-lock, it is the same as pressing shift-command-ctrl.
        Then I map that combo to whatever I like in my various apps.
        e.g. in VS Code, pressing caps-lock and P will run the current

        Okay, look, I don’t hate fun, but I have limited time for
        gaming, so sometimes when I’m enjoying the story of a
        single-player game but it’s kind of grindy, I’ll use Cheat
        Engine to give myself resources or something to reduce grinding.
        It’s not trivial to figure out, but it can do amazing
        things.</li>

        <li><p><a href="http://www.davidkinder.co.uk/frotz.html">Windows
        Frotz</a>: My favorite Z-machine interpreter on Windows. If you
        play interactive fiction games or know what Infocom games are,
        you probably already know what this is.  This supports all the
        various Infocom formats: zip, dat, z5, z8, etc., including z6.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="http://www.adamdawes.com/windows8/win8_frotz8.html">Frotz8</a>
        is a native Windows app based on the frotz interpreter that
        supports touch screens, and it has handy integration with the IF
        Archive.  It appears to be stagnant since 2013, so I’m not
        expecting anything new. <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://github.com/dcsch/yazmin">Yazmin</a> is a
        capable Z-machine interpreter for the Mac. It has fairly decent
        feature set including dark mode, and it supports v3, v4, v5, v7,
        and v8. To top it all off, it comes with a nice suite of stories
        to get you started. (Mac <a

        <li><p><a
        href="https://github.com/erkyrath/lectrote">Lectrote</a>: This
        is my current choice for a multi-format interpreter that handles
        more than just Z machine files, and while it’s the new kid on
        the block, it has novel features like autosave.  It looks really
        nice to me (great fonts and themes), but it uses ZVM as the Z
        interpreter, so it only supports Z3, Z4, Z5, &amp; Z8.  Other
        format support includes Glulx, Hugo, TADS, and Ink.  This seems
        to be under active development, so we’ll see where it goes.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/">Gargoyle</a>
        deserves a mention because it supports every format I’ve ever
        run across because it is basically just a wrapper for a number
        of interpreters. The default (and excellent) <a
        href="https://cspiegel.github.io/bocfel/">Bocfel</a> Z machine
        interpreter has partial support for z6 files too.  Its other
        claim to fame is its focus on good typesetting, which is a
        really interesting niche.  But be warned, it essentially has no
        user interface, so you need to edit a text file to change fonts
        and whatnot.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="http://maher.filfre.net/filfre/index.html">Filfre</a>:
        This is easier to use than Gargoyle for sure, so I’m mentioning
        it here, but it has minimal customization options. You might
        want to choose this if you need Glulx support and want an
        interface similar to Windows Frotz.  It’s probably not the best
        choice for Z-Machine files because it only supports versions 3,
        4, 5, and 8 story files. The project has been stagnant since
        2013, so what you see is what you get.

        <li><p><a href="http://www.trizbort.com/">Trizbort</a>: If you
        play IF games, you know mapping is essential, and Trizbort helps
        you do that.  There is even an automap function that works
        pretty well. <strong>(Windows)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>A good cross-platform alternative is <a
        href="https://trizbort.io/">Trizbort.io</a> which is a webapp
        version of Trizbort with most of the same functionality. Works
        great in any browser. This is what I use on Mac and Linux.</li>
