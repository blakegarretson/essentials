<p><strong>Welcome to my carefully curated list of the best free Windows programs!</strong></p>
<p>This is the software that I find essential on a Windows computer. These are the programs that I either immediately install when I setup a computer, or I end up installing as I need them. In most instances I have tried a number of solutions before choosing one that I like the most, so I maintain this list for my own convenience so I can quickly remind myself of (and find) all of the software that I thought was best the last time I evaluated a category.</p>
<p>All of these programs are free for personal use, and most are open-source as well. If there are commercial versions available for a program, the free version listed here is not a time-limited trial, and it is useful without upgrading to a paid version. In some cases I have listed alternatives, honorable mentions, or close seconds. Having said that, I try not to include redundant programs unless they bring something to the party.</p>
<p>Have a suggestion for a great program that should be on my list? Let me know about it! Have a comment or correction on something on this website? Click on the <a href="https://forms.gle/swSCivmLBwTxRwY27">Feedback</a> link and let me know!</p>
<h1 id="images-video">Images &amp; Video</h1>
<h2 id="video-player">Video Player</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a>: Video player for nearly any format imaginable. Especially useful for when you need to do uncommon things like adjust audio/Bluetooth sync or load custom subtitles. The interface isn’t fancy, but it has the features you need and stays out of your way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="photoimage-editor">Photo/Image Editor</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>: Robust image editor similar to Photoshop. It might not be appropriate for a casual user who just wants to crop some photos, but it’s not really suited for DTP pros either since it’s missing native CMYK support. Having said that, if you’re doing non-print stuff, it will almost certainly get the job done if you have the patience to learn the tool. Bonus: the scripting allows for complex plugins and automation.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html">Paint.NET</a> is a fantastic alternative to GIMP for those weary of the learning curve (or the name). It is less powerful than GIMP, but it’s easy to use and really polished. It’s the Paint program Microsoft should have shipped with Windows.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="photo-managementviewing-and-casual-editing">Photo Management/Viewing (and Casual Editing)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://x.photoscape.org/">Photoscape X</a>: Great program for photo viewing and basic touch-up. It makes it easy to do common tasks like cropping to standard sizes and removing red-eye. There is a Pro version with extra features, but the free version boasts a truly impressive feature set that is more than enough for most people. If you buy the Pro version it’s because you like it so much, not because you felt forced into it because the free version was so crippled.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the Photoscape X workflow doesn’t agree with you, my runner up is <a href="https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/">XnView MP</a>. It has a somewhat old school interface with simple controls that may be more intuitive for some people. It has all the essential functions and more.</p></li>
<li><p>If all you need is a super-fast, image viewer (that incidentally has some robust editing features), look no further than <a href="https://www.irfanview.com/">IrfanView</a>. I started using it in the late 1990s, and it is still going strong. This is a great program to make your default action when clicking on JPEGs, GIFs, and PNGs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="raw-photography-workflow">Raw Photography Workflow</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.darktable.org/">darktable</a>: If you work with RAW photo files or want to get the most out of your photos, you need a non-destructive post-production software like darktable. This isn’t about “photoshopping” a picture; instead it’s all about histograms, levels, curves, sharpening, colors, lens correction, noise, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vector-image-editor">Vector Image Editor</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a>: Really nice vector image editor for creating professional quality, scalable diagrams, logos, you-name-it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="artistic-image-editor">Artistic Image Editor</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>: Great digital painting software. It actually could replace Gimp for many use cases, and it supports CMYK.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another cool option is Autodesk’s <a href="https://sketchbook.com/">Sketchbook</a>, which is now free (although you will need to create a free Autodesk ID to register it.).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="screenshotsscreen-capture">Screenshots/Screen Capture</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://getsharex.com/">ShareX</a>: You don’t know how useful a good screenshot tool is until you start using it. It’s really handy to automatically save screenshots (or portions of screens) to a predetermined folder and keep it on the clipboard as well. ShareX takes it one step further and will upload the image to pretty much any site you like, and the OCR functionality is really cool. The icing on the cake is the screen capture capability that will let you record portions of your screen and save it to a GIF (or other formats). It’s great for playing tech support with family to show them how to do stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://getgreenshot.org/">Greenshot</a> was my old favorite, and you may want to use it if ShareX is confusing or seems like overkill.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Worth noting:</em></strong> recent versions of Windows 10 now come with a tool called “Snip &amp; Sketch” that does something similar (use SHIFT + WINDOWS + S key combo to access it), although it doesn’t automatically save the image to a file.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="video-conversion">Video Conversion</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://handbrake.fr/">HandBrake</a>: Convert video from/to nearly any format. While incredibly powerful and complex, HandBrake makes it really simple to get started. If you don’t want anything special, just drag and drop a file, select a preset target format (e.g. Roku 1080p30 or Android 720p30), and hit start.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you want to convert your DVD library, you’ll need to put the <a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/libdvdcss/1.2.11/win64/libdvdcss-2.dll">libdvdcss</a> library in the Handbrake directory.</p></li>
<li><p>If Handbrake is too confusing and all you want to do is rip a DVD, <a href="http://www.makemkv.com/">MakeMKV</a> rips and decodes DVDs (even with copy protection). It just isn’t as versatile as Handbrake.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="video-editing">Video Editing</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.shotcut.org/">Shotcut</a> is a capable multi-track editor with a nice interface. If I don’t need anything special, this is the first place I reach.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://kdenlive.org">kdenlive</a>: If you do need something special like key-framing, it’s great to have kdenlive in the toolbox. Shotcut has it beat in a few areas, so I still prefer it in general, but kdenlive has some features that make it worth having around.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="also-check-out">Also check out:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/">DaVinci Resolve</a>: This is a professional package, but they have a free version that’s very impressive. It outshines the above editors in features, but I’m reluctant to learn a free tool that could be retracted at a whim, so in general the opensource tools above get my vote.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.openshot.org/">Openshot</a>: I’m listing this to remind myself to keep an eye on its development. Feature-wise, it seems like it falls right between Shotcut and kdevlive, but it feels pretty buggy yet. Having said that, it might scratch your itch, and it’s worth checking out along with the others.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="animation">Animation</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>: 3D modeling and animation. Has more power than I have skill, but other people do really cool things with it. It’s fun to play with though and is worth the download.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.synfig.org/">Synfig Studio</a>: Nice 2D animation package. I dabble with projects, and when I do, this works for me.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="media-server">Media Server</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://plex.tv/">Plex</a>: The best personal media server for steaming your media to your Roku, Fire Stick, smart TV, etc. Just tell Plex where you store your movies, TV shows, and music and it will do the rest, including downloading cover art and show descriptions. I actually run my Plex server on a Linux SBC now, so I don’t technically need this on Windows anymore, but I’m keeping it on my list for posterity because it’s really fantastic software.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="music-audio">Music &amp; Audio</h1>
<h2 id="music-library-organization-and-playback">Music Library Organization and Playback</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://getmusicbee.com/">MusicBee</a>: A great way to organize and play your local music library. Includes handy features like gapless playback and auto-tagging. An app like this is becoming less essential as I move to online services like Amazon Prime Music and Spotify, but when I do want to work with local music files, it’s hard to do better than MusicBee.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/">MP3Tag</a> is a universal batch tag editor that handles MP3s along with every other popular audio format. The robust file renaming/retagging tools and online database lookups make this powerful option for cleaning up your audio collection. It’s worth having around for the odd job that MusicBee can’t handle.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="audio-editor">Audio Editor</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>: Legit multi-track audio editor. From recording, to mixing, to filters and effects, Audacity has you covered.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="audio-conversion">Audio Conversion</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.freac.org/">fre:ac</a>: free audio converter and CD ripper for various formats and encoders including MP3, MP4/M4A, AAC, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="digital-audio-workstation">Digital Audio Workstation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk">Cakewalk</a>: This used to be a commercial DAW that is now free as of 2018. It’s a rebranded version of SONAR Platinum, and it’s incredibly powerful. This is a great place to start if you want to make some music.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-sequencer">Step Sequencer</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lmms.io/">LMMS</a>: Its website says it’s a “sound generation system, synthesizer, beat/baseline editor and MIDI control system which can power an entire home studio”. I’d call it a nice step sequencer with VST and SoundFont support for creating music. I wouldn’t call it a DAW because it doesn’t record multitrack audio, but combined with Audacity, you can make some cool stuff. Honestly, I wouldn’t even list LMMS now that Cakewalk is free, except LMMS is opensource, and Cakewalk may go away sometime in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synth-plugins">Synth Plugins</h2>
<ul>
<li>A couple great synths plugins worth trying with LMMS and Cakewalk are <a href="https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/">dexed</a> and <a href="https://tytel.org/helm/">Helm</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="text-editors">Text Editors</h1>
<p><em>There may be some redundancy here, but text editors are like knives: you wouldn’t use a Bowie knife when you need a scalpel or a steak knife when you need a machete, so I use multiple editors depending on the task.</em></p>
<h2 id="all-purpose-text-editors">All-Purpose Text Editors</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a> is easy to recommend for general text editing and quick file edits simply because it is blazing fast and the interface stays out of your way. This is my default application for text files, and over the years I’ve written many thousands of lines of code in Notepad++. Having said that, the antiquated syntax coloring system and somewhat clunky customization limits how well it scales to many tasks. But it still is a fast editor and it shines when opening a 1 GB log file… as long as it doesn’t need to be syntax colored as well.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://neovim.io">Neovim</a>: vi was a legendary, powerful keyboard-based text editor with a steep learning curve, Vim is its most successful clone (itself being a derivative of Stevie), and Neovim aims at pushing Vim into the 21st century with a clean code base and features like Lua extensibility and asynchronous plugins which allow for things like async linters. Some people think it’s silly to use a vi clone more than four decades after it was introduced, but there are some tasks that are orders of magnitude faster in a vi clone than modern mouse-oriented text editors.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a console-based text editor is what you need and you don’t love the vi modal editing and key bindings, you should really check out <a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a>. Micro works from a console, but it has modern capabilities like mouse support, multiple cursors, Lua plugins, tabs, tmux-like splits, and syntax color schemes. Best of all, the normal Windows key bindings like CTRL-C, CTRL-V, CTRL-S, and CTRL-Z work as expected.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> is a fast, clean, good looking editor, and it gets points for popularizing (if not actually inventing) the command palette and document map (and maybe even multiple cursors?), but I want to like it more than I actually do. Maybe I’m just too old to learn new key bindings? You should check it out though. Sublime is truly excellent software. (Note: You can evaluate Sublime Text for free with no feature limitations or time limits, but you should pay if you continue to use it. So technically it doesn’t meet my criteria for this website as “free”.)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a> is a jack-of-all-trades that is <em>good</em> at everything, but not best-in-class in anything. It is a versatile cross-platform programmer’s text editor that you can configure to be anything from a simple Notepad.exe replacement to an ultra-lightweight IDE. It’s just hard to recommend because while it’s good for quick edits and opening text files, Notepad++ is even faster for those quick tasks. And while Geany is really nice for light coding, VS Code is even better. Geany is rarely the <em>best</em> tool for the job, but it might be the right choice for a Windows box that just needs an all-purpose, do-it-all editor. If you do try it, there are lots of great features hidden in the <a href="https://www.geany.org/download/releases/">official plugin package</a>, so be sure to grab it as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="programming-editoride">Programming Editor/IDE</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>: I think Microsoft shocked a lot of people when they knocked VS Code out of the park. I didn’t see it coming, but it is a legitimately great editor for just about any language. From linter to debugging, everything you need can be integrated into a seamless workflow. Check out the extensions to add nearly any functionality you could want, turning VS Code into a legitimate IDE. <em>Note: Don’t confuse VS Code with <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio</a> which is a full-blown IDE with more advanced features that I don’t find necessary for the hobbyist.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prose-text-editor">Prose Text Editor</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://writemonkey.com/">WriteMonkey</a>: For writing prose, it’s hard to beat this distraction-free text editor. It has Markdown support and other handy features that push it to the front of the pack for its genre. Check out version 3 for the newest cross-platform codebase.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gottcode.org/focuswriter/">FocusWriter</a>: If the command palette interface of WriteMonkey 3 is a deal-breaker for you, a good runner-up is FocusWriter. It has a more classic distraction-free interface, and it has plenty of convenience features like smart quote conversion.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="programming">Programming</h1>
<p><em>Note: See the <a href="#text-editors">Text Editors</a> section for programming text editors and IDEs.</em></p>
<h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>: A distributed version control system that quickly took over the open source world, and with good reason. If you’re a programmer, you already know what this is. A <em>big</em> bonus even for non-programmers is the installer includes all the Unix command-line tools you know and love. If you need ls, cat, grep, awk, and all the rest, I think this is the easiest way to add them to your Windows system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="text-comparison">Text Comparison</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://meldmerge.org/">Meld</a>: My favorite graphical file comparison (AKA “diff”) program. There is 2 and 3-way file diff and merge, as well as directory comparison. It also plays nicely with many version control systems including Git.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compiled-language">Compiled Language</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>: Even though I don’t do a ton of programming in compiled languages on Windows, when I do, I am usually making command line programs like file utilities, text manipulators, number crunching programs, etc, and Go fits the bill nicely.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scripting-language---general-purpose">Scripting Language - General Purpose</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>: My favorite general purpose programming language. It’s perfect for getting the job done quickly without a lot of boilerplate and heavy lifting. I’m a pragmatic engineer, so I just want to solve a problem as efficiently and elegantly as possible, and I’ll leave the arguing about static typing and whatnot to the real developers and CS engineers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All the essential Python libraries are on PyPi, so here is a pip command line (for easy cutting and pasting) useful for STEM programming to get you started. This is a short list, but it pulls the more important dependencies like scipy, pandas, and numpy: <code>pip install jupyterlab seaborn PyQt5 pillow markdown sympy statsmodels</code></p></li>
<li><p>And a quick description of a couple of packages vital for STEM:</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section"></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> is a scientific package useful for everything from statistics to linear algebra.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> handles data structures and data manipulation.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a> is the foundation for numeric arrays, and math functions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a> is a symbolic computer algebra system.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> is a robust plotting library.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a> is a higher level package built on matplotlib that can really improve your productivity.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt</a>: Probably the best looking, best featured, cross-platform GUI toolkit.</p></li>
<li><p>Also worth checking out are <a href="https://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>, which is a really nice toolkit that I’ve used on a number of projects, and <a href="https://kivy.org/#home">Kivy</a>, which accommodates mobile platforms with features like multi-touch support.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scripting-language---mathscience">Scripting Language - Math/Science</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a>: Just an incredible tool for mathematical or scientific computing of any kind. The lightweight syntax is a delight even by Python standards, and its speed usually matches or beats compiled languages due to its JIT compiler and language design. Julia is made for speed (both in writing and execution), and I think it combines the best of Python, Fortran, MATLAB, and R. I use it more as a math tool than a general purpose scripting language, hence this separate category.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you like Julia, you might like the <a href="https://juliamono.netlify.app">JuliaMono</a> font. I can’t justify listing this with the other fonts below because it’s so specific to Julia, but this is an interesting font intended to leverage Julia’s excellent Unicode support for actual math operations. Check out the website for examples.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="programming-fonts">Programming Fonts</h2>
<p><em>Below are a few truly excellent fonts suitable for programming, consoles, terminal windows, PuTTY, etc. While just one font should be sufficient, I typically have all of these installed as one font may look better in a certain terminal or editor, at a particular size or scaling, or on a particular monitor.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/">Dina</a>: Great bitmap font in 6, 8, 9, and 10 points with normal, bold, italic, and bold/italic faces. I like the 8 and 10 especially well. Dina is so clear and crisp on even the worst monitors that it is actually pleasurable to read.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro">Source Code Pro</a>: This font from Adobe looks very clean on high resolution monitors. The family of fonts includes Extra Light, Light, Medium, and Black variations. This is just a simple, no frills font that’s easy to throw on a random computer to get a decent font quickly. Perfect for when the two fonts below can be overkill.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://input.fontbureau.com/">Input</a>: Incredibly flexible font system that lets you customize letters (a/g/i/l/0) and symbols (asterisk/braces) to your liking, as well as choose from 7 weights and 4 widths, and sans, serif, and mono variants. There are 168 styles in all, so you will find one that works for any given situation.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/">Iosevka</a>: Similar to the Input font, Iosevka raises the bar by adding ligatures, a couple more weights, 188 variants, and incredible character coverage with thousands and thousands of supported glyphs. While you can’t customize individual characters like Input, there are variants with different character and symbol styles, so you should be able to find one that has the look you want. There are so many choices it can be confusing, but if want a general purpose font that works everywhere (but doesn’t have ligatures), start with the “Iosevka Fixed” font.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="document-authoring-viewing">Document Authoring &amp; Viewing</h1>
<h2 id="pdf-viewing">PDF Viewing</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/products/pdf-reader.html">Acrobat Reader</a>: The original and probably still the best PDF viewer. Due to poor performance, I used to prefer alternatives like <a href="https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader/">Foxit Reader</a>, but Foxit started catching up in the bloat category and either Acrobat got better or my computers got faster.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ebook-utilities">eBook Utilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>: All-in-one ebook manager. Whatever you need to do to/with an ebook, this will do it. It organizes, converts, downloads covers, etc.. Absolutely indispensable if you have a non-DRM ebook collection. With plug-ins you can even strip DRM to backup your purchases. (Pro tip: search for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=calibre+DeDRM">calibre DeDRM</a>”)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.turnipsoft.co.uk/freda/">Freda</a>: A nice standalone e-reader that handles the popular formats like mobi and ePub. The main advantage it has over Calibre’s built-in reader is the extensive customization options and font rendering.</p>
<ul>
<li>The honorable mention goes to <a href="https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html">Sumatra PDF</a> because it is a convenient all-in-one reader for PDF, EPUB, MOBI, CBR, CBZ, CHM, and XPS. While Sumatra might not be the best solution for ebooks or comics, it’s handy to have around, and some books even look better in Sumatra (usually because of font rendering).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="comic-reader">Comic Reader</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.yacreader.com/">YACReader</a> is actually two programs in one. It comes with an excellent comic reader and a comics library browser. It reads every popular format (cbr, cbz, cb7, pdf, etc.), and it has all the features I need.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markup-texlatex-tools">Markup &amp; TeX/LaTeX Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>: Convert markup formats to other formats. Handles Markdown, html, EPUB, LaTeX, etc. This is an extremely powerful program, and I actually use it to build this website.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.miktex.org/">MiKTeX</a>: A port of the TeX document publishing system that converts source files into beautifully typeset documents. If you know what TeX/LaTeX are, you need this. If you don’t know what they are, <em>and</em> you care about breathtaking documents, then you need to learn TeX.</p>
<ul>
<li>This isn’t a software link, but a really useful site about LaTeX fonts is <a href="http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/">here</a>. And while I’m breaking the rules and posting web links, <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/">here’s</a> a really good website for LaTeX info.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/">TeXstudio</a>: Lightweight portable LaTeX IDE, including editor, spell checker, and symbol toolbars. For those keeping track, this was forked from TeXMaker back in 2009, and it’s clearly outpaced it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="office-suite">Office Suite</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>: Provides all the usual “office” suspects, like a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation applications. While still lacking the polish of MS Office, for most use cases this is a passable replacement. The key functionality is there, and the major gaps of the early releases (e.g. Goal Seek and Pivot Tables) have long since been filled. Worth noting: LibreOffice Draw works well for flowcharts (similar to Visio).</p>
<ul>
<li>Full disclosure, I don’t find LibreOffice essential in the sense that I use it often. I like LibreOffice as a convenience so I can easily open an MS Office file or perform the odd task, but I actually far prefer working in the cloud with Google Docs and Sheets. In some ways, Sheets is even better than Excel or LibreOffice Calc with conveniences like the <code>split()</code> function.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="note-taking">Note-Taking</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.onenote.com/download">OneNote</a> is easy to recommend given the comprehensive functionality and the fact that it is now free. For many tasks, I’ve always been a plain text file guy, and I think note-taking apps are unnecessary when a text editor works fine. <em>However,</em> I use OneNote at work extensively, and I really like it. I can integrate emails, pictures, tables, and all the rest into a workflow organized by notebooks, sections, and pages. OneNote wasn’t the first to the note-taking scene, but veterans like <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> are charging hefty monthly fees for functionality that is free in OneNote.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="desktop-publishing">Desktop Publishing</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a> is the best free desktop publishing solution out there; perfect for making flyers, invitations, banners, stationary, and even full books. When a casual user needs something more than Word, but can’t justify buying Adobe InDesign, Scribus is the next best thing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sheet-music">Sheet Music</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://musescore.org/en">MuseScore</a>: Easy-to-use interface for creating sheet music. With great documentation and abundant resources like videos, tutorials, and how-tos, you will be creating great looking sheet music documents in no time.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to make sheet music and have complete control over every aspect of the output, <a href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a> is where it’s at. There’s no GUI, it’s super niche software, so it’s not for everyone, but the results are sublime.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="science-math-and-engineering">Science, Math, and Engineering</h1>
<h2 id="calculator">Calculator</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.speedcrunch.org/">SpeedCrunch</a>: Lightweight calculator with fast start-up and plenty of functionality. The interface is deceptively simple, but lurking under the hood are constants, variables, an impressive list of math functions, and equation support. This is the first app I reach for when I need to do some quick math on the desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you need a graphing calculator, check out the <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/download">GeoGebra</a> app suite. There are several downloadable apps in the suite, and there is some overlap, but try downloading both the graphing calculator and the CAS calculator and see which works best for you. The CAS version lets you do things like integrate and derive formulas as you graph them. (Note: This is an easy-to-use app only suitable for high school or low level college problems. For a real CAS, see below.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="graphingplotting">Graphing/Plotting</h2>
<p><em>The Python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn (see <a href="#programming">Programming</a>) make standalone graphing software somewhat redundant for me, but the feature sets and easier-to-use interfaces make these still worth checking out.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/">gnuplot</a>: While it has a steeper learning curve than a typical GUI driven program, gnuplot’s spartan interface helps you plot and tweak quickly without having to know the commands. This venerable GNU program has been around since the 1980s quietly excelling in its domain. If something can be plotted at all, it can probably be plotted by gnuplot. You might want to start with the demo gallery to see what it can do.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://veusz.github.io/">Veusz</a> is a great plotting package that has a robust graphical interface and an impressive array of supported plot types. From 2D to 3D, from box plots to polar plots, Veusz has you covered. The main selling point for me is that you have total control of everything you see on the graph: colors, lines, fonts, you name it. There are some downsides, most notably: strange handling of error bars, poor histogram functionality, and the data manipulation could be better.</p>
<ul>
<li>If Veusz isn’t doing it for you, <a href="https://labplot.kde.org">LabPlot</a> is fantastic software if you only need XY plots, although it does adequate histograms as well. It is very customizable, but be aware it takes some exploration to really figure out everything it can do. You can make some incredible looking plots that would look at home in even the prettiest info-graphics. There are plot “themes” which make it easy to quickly try out some different looks. Labplot will definitely produce something that doesn’t look like just another Excel plot.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xy-plot-digitizer">XY Plot Digitizer</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://markummitchell.github.io/engauge-digitizer/">Engauge Digitizer</a> is a lifesaver when you need to extract X-Y data from a raster format image or a printed graph from a book or pdf. Instead of breaking out the ruler, just click on some points and Engauge will scale, transform, and orient the plot for you, exporting the XY data to a CSV file.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="computer-algebra-systems-numerical-analysis">Computer Algebra Systems &amp; Numerical Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a> aims to replace commercial software like Mathematica, Maple, and Matlab, and it has advanced enough that it really does make those packages unnecessary for many use cases. Sage brings some of the best tools in the open-source world together under one interface to create an incredibly powerful package that’s useful to nearly every STEM field. The main problem with Sage is the complete absence of a user interface. The novice is presented with an empty prompt, and is expected to know what to type. It could really benefit from a cohesive graphical interface that guides the user a little better (like wxMaxima or the commercial options).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/windows-install.html">Maxima</a>: Symbolic computer algebra system with robust plotting. Be sure to use the bundled app called wxMaxima, which is an easy-to-use graphical interface that wraps the Maxima backend. Given that SageMath has Maxima built in, this standalone version may seem redundant, but novices will find wxMaxima easier to jump into and start using right away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Runner-up for simple symbolic algebra is <a href="https://www.sympy.org">SymPy</a>, which technically isn’t an application, but rather a Python library.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">GNU Octave</a>: A numerical computation program that started off as a MATLAB clone, so porting programs is fairly trivial. The use cases of a program like this (for me) are pretty narrow these days given the accessibility and capabilities of programming languages like Julia and Python (along with libraries like Scipy and Numpy), and the advancement of more broad-purpose software like SageMath. Octave is still immensely powerful though, and a great environment for mathematical exploration, so I’m leaving it on my list. Also note that SageMath has an Octave interface, so if you have it in your path, you can call Octave functions directly from Sage.</p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious runner-up here for numerical computation is <a href="https://www.scilab.org/">Scilab</a>, which has a long history as a capable numerical analysis package and has always had significant overlap in functionality with Octave (and MATLAB for that matter). You may like Scilab better for some reason, so if you’re serious about math you should check it out, but the Octave community is more active and there are more libraries available for Octave, so I’d still start there.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interactive-programmingdata-environment">Interactive Programming/Data Environment</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyterlab</a> (or Jupyter) is an interactive notebook where you can embed code and plots and easily share the sessions with others or save them for later. This is a front end for scientific computing languages like Python, R, and Julia that is perfect for interactive exploration. I could have easily listed this under the Programming category, but Jupyter is really more of a scientific computing platform than a programming environment.  This is where you do math or data science, explore statistics, and slice, dice, and manipulate data before analysis and visualization.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.jamovi.org/">Jamovi</a>: This is a great package for quickly analyzing some data and making decent-looking stats plots with very little effort. If I want simple descriptive statistics, a histogram, or a quick t-test, Jamovi makes it easy (although honestly, if I need much more than that I’m probably in Jupyter using Python with libraries like Pandas to help slice and dice the data.) Jamovi looks very polished, and the core functionality is there, but I wish there were more customization options for the graphs and more data manipulation tools. Also, it’s worth noting that Jamovi is one of the many front-ends for R, the 800-pound-gorilla of stats packages, so there are a number of modules available to add functionality. Jamovi is under very active development, and new releases come out at least monthly, so I’m excited to see what’s coming in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://jasp-stats.org/">JASP</a> looks very similar to Jamovi, and in fact, at first glance the interfaces appear to be near clones. While I find Jamovi just plain better in a number of ways, I’m keeping my eye on JASP because it appears to be under active development as well, and JASP supports some analyses that Jamovi doesn’t while still offering an easy-to-use interface.</p></li>
<li><p>On paper, <a href="https://www.blueskystatistics.com/">BlueSky Statistics</a> should be the easy winner in this category. It has many,many more features than Jamovi. However, I don’t find the interface as intuitive for casual analysis, and by default the plotslook fairly bad. The plots can certainly be tweaked through the R language, but it isn’t transparent to the casual user. Besidesthe impressive collection of analysis methods, the real reason I might reach for BlueSky instead of Jamovi is the robust set ofdata manipulation tools.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/infrastructure/past/">PAST</a> is the only non-“R front-end” in this category. If youlook past the deceptively plain interface, this is a super powerful stats program chock-full of functionality. There’s no safetynet or hand-holding to help you interpret the results, but it has an amazing manual describing the equations used and evenincludes extensive citations, so this is no black box. It has a very robust set of statistical plotting tools, and thehistograms are actually pretty good with a fair amount of customization (including overlaying a normal distribution).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="d3d-cad-modeling">2D/3D CAD Modeling</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/fusion-360-for-hobbyists">Autodesk Fusion 360</a>: I hate to rely on proprietary software that might be pulled behind a paywall tomorrow, but Fusion 360 is a professional-grade 3D modeler that can’t be passed up when they’re giving it away for free. Professionally, I’ve used everything from Pro/E to Catia to I-DEAS to NX to Inventor and a half dozen more CAD packages, and Fusion 360 is as good as any of them for creating 3D models. The interface is incredibly intuitive if you’ve used any real CAD package before. If you sign up as a hobbyist (i.e. not for commercial use) you can get a free license. They recently further crippled the free version (e.g. file format support and number of active documents allowed), but it’s still very usable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two free (and open source) CAD alternatives worth trying if the Fusion 360 restrictions are non-starters for you:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-1"></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>: Fairly full-featured 2D/3D parametric CAD modeler. This is the only open source CAD program that looks even remotely like a real, commercial CAD program, and it’s capabilities are pretty amazing for what it is, but it’s still painful for me to use compared to any good commercial product. The interface can be clunky and seems to work against me at every step, and for some tasks I just can’t figure out an efficient workflow (or can’t figure out how to accomplish it at all). Having said that, there is a lot of great functionality here, including a decent CAM module that generates very usable G-code.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://solvespace.com/index.pl">Solvespace</a> is such a tiny, fast, quirky, unique, and capable program, I had to mention it. Don’t let the retro look fool you. This is a powerful 2D/3D parametric modeler with a legit constraint solver. Besides FreeCAD, that is a very rare find in free CAD software. This interface is nothing like a standard CAD package, but if you are into making 3D objects for 3D printing, this program is great. For normal use, I think the glaring omission in its feature set is a tool for adding fillets/rounds. That’s a deal breaker for me.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="electronics-schematics">Electronics Schematics</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.expresspcb.com/pcb-cad-software/">ExpressSCH</a>: This is a really simple program for making quick schematics. Download Classic ExpressPCB and you’ll get ExpressSCH too.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a> is WAY more powerful than ExpressSCH in every way possible, but it’s usually overkill for my simple needs. If you’re looking for an electronics design program, you’re probably looking for KiCad.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gpx-viewer">GPX Viewer</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gpxsee.org/">GPXSee</a> is a simple GPX viewer with basic conveniences like speed/elevation graphs and several map source options (including topo maps). It’s the perfect track viewer for hikers and other outdoor sports where you might record a path with a GPS or one of the many mobile apps that does offline mapping.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="geographical-mapping-software">Geographical Mapping Software</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/">JOSM</a> is fairly niche software, but if you want to edit a GPX file (or even OpenStreetMap data), this is probably your best bet. It is shocking how many terrible GPX editors are out there, and JOSM stands out as a truly capable package in comparison, even if it can be unintuitive at times. If you need to edit a GPS track to clean it up before uploading to a website or archiving, JOSM is your best bet.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> is where you go when you want to work with GIS data to make custom maps, combine map data from various sources, etc. There is overlap between QGIS and JOSM for sure, but they really do different things, so it’s worth having both in your toolbox if you are into maps. My favorite function in QGIS is the Georeferencer tool which lets you map a raster image map onto actual coordinates. This is handy for doing things like superimposing a scanned trail map onto a topo map. Speaking of which, QGIS also supports GeoPDF files, which is handy for tracing trails as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="astronomy">Astronomy</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a>: A great planetarium for the hobbyist astronomer.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="network-internet">Network &amp; Internet</h1>
<h2 id="web-browser">Web Browser</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>: My default browser since the day it was released.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I left <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> for Chrome, but I like to keep Firefox around for the odd task, and[ it is arguably more pro-consumer with its stance on ad-blockers.</p></li>
<li><p>And because you can never have too many browsers, <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> is another nice option if privacy and security are a high priority. It is essentially just Chrome with extra privacy features, but it also includes a Tor browser, which is handy. It is also very fast.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remote-shell-access">Remote Shell Access</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>: Awesome ssh/telnet client. It’s been the premier free terminal client for so many years because it’s simple and works while not skimping on features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-transfer">File Transfer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a>: Great ftp/sftp/scp client with lots of advanced features like bandwidth limiting and shutting down the program or computer after file transfers are done.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a>: Lightweight, yet powerful, BitTorrent client. This is basically uTorrent without the tedious ads. (For server use, I prefer <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a>.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remote-desktop-control">Remote Desktop Control</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://tigervnc.org/">TigerVNC</a>: If you need remote desktop control, this lightweight VNC client/server forked from TightVNC does the job. I just don’t find myself using VNC as much as I used to as I move more functions to the cloud and rely less on my own desktops.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/">Teamviewer</a>: If you play “IT Guy” for your friends and family, a tool like Teamviewer can be handy as it makes it easy for non-techy people to add remote control. I can send them a download link, they install it, and tell me the ID and password that is displayed in the app so I can connect. That’s it. No other configuration is needed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chatmessenging">Chat/Messenging</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a>: The apparent successor to Skype and Teamspeak in many communities, especially in the gaming world. I have no particular affinity to the app itself, but it works fine on both desktop and mobile, and there are some cool communities that made their home on Discord.  Of particular note is that Discord is also becoming the “new IRC” for many programming communities. The IRC channels are often less populated than the equivalent Discord channels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="honorable-mentions-1">Honorable Mentions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://desktop.telegram.org/">Telegram</a>: I really don’t need another chat protocol in my life, but Telegram is doing some things right like real cross-platform support/sync and no size restrictions when sharing media or documents. It’s a very polished experience, and features like group voice chat work exceptionally well.</p></li>
<li><p>If privacy or security is paramount to you, then <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> has Telegram beat. In Telegram, end-to-end encryption is only optional, and you can’t encrypt group chats. Signal fixes those shortcomings, but falls short of Telegram in other areas.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="two-factor-authentication">Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>: Really handy way to add 2FA to all your accounts and across all devices. There are Authy mobile apps as well, so once you add Authy to a service (Gmail, Facebook, Amazon, etc.), you are good to go whether you’re on your desktop, laptop, phone, or tablet.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="file-disk-utilities">File &amp; Disk Utilities</h1>
<h2 id="local-file-search">Local File Search</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.voidtools.com/">Everything</a>: This is the search tool that should have come with Windows. It supports wildcards, boolean operations, exact cases/phrases, and regular expressions. Just type a filename, and you’ll get immediate results from all your drives instantly. If you want to search network drives, you will need to go to Options and add them to your search folders under Indexing. You can also search file contents, although that will take much longer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.fileseek.ca/">FileSeek</a> is an excellent runner-up for desktop search with the free version having everything you need for normal use. It doesn’t require indexing, which is nice on one hand because it’s not bogging down your computer at inopportune times, but it also means searching will take longer when you execute the search.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a>: Archiver with great compression, command line support, nice GUI and Explorer integration, and it is really fast.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.peazip.org/">PeaZip</a>: If 7-zip doesn’t work for you because you’ve encountered some obscure format, PeaZip is the place to look. It supports basically every format that you would conceivably (or inconceivably) run into. You also might like its interface better than 7-zip.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disk-imagingformattingrepair">Disk Imaging/Formatting/Repair</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">balena Etcher</a>: A nice clean, easy-to-use program to write disk images to flash devices (USB drives, microSD cards, etc.). This is great for putting Linux distros on bootable USB drives or setting up a microSD card for a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<ul>
<li>Runner up goes to <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a>. It gives you more options than Etcher at the cost of some added complexity. I have also run across some images where Rufus works where Etcher fails, so it’s handy to have Rufus around even if I use Etcher most of the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.ventoy.net/">Ventoy</a> serves the same purpose as a traditional disk imager, although it adds more flexibility and functions quite differently. You install Ventoy onto a USB drive via the handy Windows installer, and then you can drop as many bootable disk images (ISO, IMG, etc.) as you like onto the drive. When you boot to the USB drive, Ventoy will give you a menu to let you choose which image to boot. Super handy way of carrying several OSes in your pocket, all on a single drive.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree">Macrium Reflect Free</a>: Great for making disk images or transitioning a computer from a traditional harddrive to an SSD. The Free edition has all the essentials, and the last SSD transition I did was seamless. I highly recommend.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager/epm-free.html">EaseUS Partition Master</a>: The Windows 10 disk management tools are limited in functionality, and sooner or later you may need a tool like this to fix/partition/format a drive. My most common use case is recovering all the space on a USB drive that has a Linux image on it, perhaps with multiple partitions, one of which is the EFI boot partition. The Windows Disk Management tools might let you delete some (but not all) partitions, while the free version of Partition Master will have you back in business in seconds. It also resizes partitions and clones disks, but the free version won’t create an image of a live OS like Macrium Reflect Free, hence I still have both listed here.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/">SD Memory Card Formatter</a> may be a simpler solution if all you need is to fix an SD card. Some devices can be finicky about the format of SD/microSD cards, and this official application from the SD Association has fixed some obscure issues I’ve had in the past. This is especially true of SDHC/SDXC cards since Windows 10 seems to like formatting higher capacity cards as NTFS instead of FAT32.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk">TestDisk</a>: If you need this, you’ve probably done something really bad like accidentally deleting a partition table. TestDisk can help you recover lost partitions, make a disk bootable again, or even recover files from deleted partitions (among other things).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-recovery">File Recovery</h2>
<p><em>Between these programs you should be able to recover any file that is physically possible to recover without special hardware. I’m listing them all because sometimes one can get the job done where another can’t.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">PhotoRec</a>: Comes in two flavors: command line and a simple graphical interface. This is the first thing I try when I need to “undelete” pictures I accidentally deleted from an SD card. Comes with TestDisk (see above).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.piriform.com/recuva">Recuva</a>: Very polished interface, and the free version has enough features for most people.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.z-a-recovery.com/">Zero Assumption Recovery</a>: The free version has some limitations, but the digital image recovery mode has no functional limitations.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://diskdigger.org/">DiskDigger</a>: Lightweight, single exe so no install necessary. While it is free for personal use, it will nag you before recovering each and every file, so if you have a lot of files to recover, it is worth just buying it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disk-performance">Disk Performance</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskmark/">CrystalDiskMark</a>: If you want to check the read/write speed of any storage device, you can’t do much better than this free MIT-licensed app. A tool like this really helps weed out the trash if you like to buy cheap SD cards or flash drives. Some are worth buying again while others aren’t, and CrystalDiskMark gives you the data to make that decision.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-deletion">File Deletion</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://eraser.heidi.ie/">Eraser</a>: Secure deletion with a nice GUI and Explorer integration. Useful if you don’t like the idea of having remnants of tax returns and whatnot on drives. The advent of modern SSD drives has thrown a monkey wrench in secure deletion, so do some research before trusting that your file is really gone. (Hint: it’s probably not.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disk-encryption">Disk Encryption</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">VeraCrypt</a>: On-the-fly disk and file encryption. Works absolutely seamlessly with the OS so you wouldn’t even know you are using an encrypted disk. This is a continuation of the old TrueCrypt program.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disk-usage">Disk Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://wiztreefree.com/">WizTree</a>: The best way to see which files are eating up your diskspace. It is INSANELY fast because it uses the master file table instead of querying each file.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://windirstat.net/">Windirstat</a> was my favorite for years, and it’s still a great option, but it is slower than Wiztree.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="batch-file-operations">Batch File Operations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.cylog.org/utilities/wildrename.jsp">WildRename</a>: Wonderfully robust file renaming utility that supports regular expressions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.cylog.org/utilities/wildreplace.jsp">WildReplace</a>: Search for files and replace text in the files.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="backupsynchronization">Backup/Synchronization</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFileSync</a>: Local backup and synchronization program to do things like make nightly backups from one hard drive to another.</p>
<ul>
<li>For something more involved than simple “folder sync”, <a href="https://www.duplicati.com/">Duplicati</a> might be what you need. It does incremental backups and data deduplication, and it works nicely over a network, making remote admin a breeze.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-sync/">Google Backup and Sync</a>: For realtime cloud backup and synchronization, this is an easy solution if you’re invested into the Google ecosystem, which I am. Backs up photos and anything else I tell it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maybe you don’t trust Google or you want more control of your data. If you’d rather host your own cloud, it’s hard to beat <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. If it’s confusing why this is different than something like FreeFileSync, Syncthing shines at realtime <em>continuous</em> synchronization while FreeFileSync is geared towards a file backup that runs (for instance) once a day. The huge bonus is the Syncthing Android app, allowing you to sync files between your computer and your phone.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, if you are an Amazon Prime member, it’s hard to pass up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16384500011">Amazon Photos desktop app</a> which let’s you backup unlimited photos at their original resolution for free.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="system-misc.-utilities">System &amp; Misc. Utilities</h1>
<h2 id="package-managementsoftware-installer">Package Management/Software Installer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>: If you wish you had Linux-like package management on Windows (e.g. apt, yum, or pacman), Chocolatey has you covered. It took me a while to come around to liking Chocolatey, but nowadays it is robust and has broad package support. It supports thousands of packages, and the vast majority of the software listed on Blake’s Essentials can be found there. If you’re setting up a new computer (or several computers), Chocolatey can be a huge time saver.</p>
<ul>
<li>The other popular package manager out there is <a href="https://ninite.com/">Ninite</a>. It’s great, but it  just doesn’t have near the number of packages as Chocolatey. If Ninite supports all the packages you want, you might want to try it first. Personally, I see Ninite as something I can use on my parents’ computer to keep their software up to date.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uninstaller">Uninstaller</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/products/revo-uninstaller-free/">Revo Uninstaller Free</a>: Uninstalling programs using the usual methods often leaves a lot of junk around. Revo does a better job at really removing a program.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="system-cleaner">System Cleaner</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.bleachbit.org/">Bleachbit</a> will delete stuff you don’t need hanging around like logs, temporary files, “recently used” lists, thumbnails, you-name-it. There are a lot of options out there in this category, but I like Bleachbit because it’s completely free and open-source, so at least you know what it’s trying to do under the hood. Be aware that it is highly debated whether you should even use a program like this as Windows has it’s own tools to clean up after itself, and mucking about in the registry can cause problems you didn’t ask for.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/">CCleaner</a> has been around forever, and it’s still a good choice for cleaning up your system. The main advantage it has over Bleachbit is the ability to fix a plethora of registry issues. (Again, maybe it’s better to let it alone and not mess with the registry?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consolecommand-line">Console/Command Line</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/">ConEmu</a>: The console emulator that I always dreamed of on Windows, but never had. It is a must if you use the command line in Windows. It is basically just a wrapper for cmd.exe, Powershell, Python, whatever, but it is very configurable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also worth considering is Microsoft’s newly minted <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal">Windows Terminal</a> which works very well as of version 1.0, but it lacks the feature set of ConEmu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stahlworks.com/dev/swiss-file-knife.html">Swiss File Knife</a>: This is the essential command line tool set for Windows. It does a little of everything, and you need to just read the list of commands on the website to believe it. It’s a single executable, so it’s portable as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clipboard-manager">Clipboard Manager</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/">CopyQ</a> extends the Windows clipboard so you can access more than just the last item copied. Advanced scripting, editing, and keyboard shortcuts make this a real powerhouse of productivity once you learn the tool.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="password-manager">Password Manager</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> is the best open source, cross-platform password manager that I’ve ever tried. And the best part is the free version is more than enough for most people. I will say even though I’m linking the Windows version here, I generally just use the browser extension, which is excellent and available for every browser. The companion mobile apps are likewise excellent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hex-editor">Hex Editor</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">HxD</a>: Has everything I need in a hex editor. Simple and lightweight.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microsoft-product-key-recovery">Microsoft Product Key Recovery</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html">ProduKey</a> is super handy when you want to reinstall Windows or Office after your hard drive crashes or you just want to start fresh.. Just run this program, save the output somewhere safe, and you have your Microsoft product keys ready to go for Windows and Office.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="utilities-suites">Utilities Suites</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/">Windows Sysinternals</a>: This is a collection of tools that has been around since the 1990s, and was eventually acquired by Microsoft because they are so good. (And they are still being updated!) You can download the whole suite, or individual tools.  I’m going to highlight just a couple here to give you the flavor of the suite, but it’s worth perusing the whole list and seeing what’s available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer">Process Explorer</a>: If you can’t delete a file because some program has it locked, Process Explorer will tell you what program has the file handle open.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon">Process Monitor</a>: Sometimes you need to know what files a process is changing, or maybe you want to know which program is changing a file. Process Monitor, um, well, it <strong><em>monitors</em></strong> your <strong><em>processes</em></strong> to find that out.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">Microsoft PowerToys</a>: Old-timers will remember this suite for decades ago, but it’s back and better than ever (and open sourced!). This collection of Windows enhancements include adding Markdown and SVG support to the Windows Explorer preview pane, windows snapping, easy image resizing, a keyboard manager that lets you remap keys, plus lots more. (Quick tip: use this to remap you CapsLock key to act like a Shift key so you aren’t aCCIDENTALLY TURNING CAPSLOCK ON. I hate that.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linux-environment">Linux Environment</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> (WSL): Run Linux tools directly in Windows without a virtual machine. Bash, Zsh, compilers, interpreters, grep, awk, and all the rest of the command line tools you need right under Windows. You actually can download this from the Microsoft Store now (for free), so there’s no direct download link. You even have your pick of various supported distros.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/">VcXsrv Windows X Server</a>: If you’re running WSL, you may want an X server to run GUI programs, and VcXsrv works great. Choose the “multiple windows” option to seamlessly integrate X programs into the Windows desktop. A couple quick tips:</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-2"></h3>
<ul>
<li>Add these lines to your <code>.bashrc</code> file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>export DISPLAY=:0.0
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1</code></pre>
<h3 id="section-3"></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t want seamless windows and you want to run an X desktop window, you probably want to install something like Xfce4:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install xfce4-terminal xfce4</code></pre>
<h3 id="section-4"></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you want a bunch of default Linux desktop apps:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop</code></pre>
<h3 id="section-5"></h3>
<ul>
<li>After starting VcXsrv, you need to start Xfce4 each session:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ startxfce4</code></pre>
<h2 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a> is the best free solution for running virtual machines. It is an easy and robust way of running Linux (and other OSes) under Windows, which is often handy for some toolchains or just testing out a script or something in a Linux environment.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="gaming">Gaming</h1>
<p><em>I’m not going to list actual games here, but rather just some gaming related software which facilitates playing games.</em></p>
<h2 id="games-launchers">Games Launchers</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>: Must-have for PC gaming. Regardless of the two options below, I prefer Steam every time I have a choice.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/">Epic Games</a>: I’m mostly here for the free games.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://download.amazongames.com/AmazonGamesSetup.exe">Amazon Games</a>: Prime members get free games, otherwise I wouldn’t bother.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="console-emulation">Console Emulation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a> has you covered if you’re looking to play some old school games from retro systems like the Atari 2600, NES, SNES, and many more.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="game-um-enhancement">Game… um… Enhancement</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cheatengine.org/">Cheat Engine</a>: Okay, look, I don’t hate fun, but I have limited time for gaming, so sometimes when I’m enjoying the story of a single-player game but it’s kind of grindy, I’ll use Cheat Engine to give myself resources or something to reduce grinding. It’s not trivial to figure out, but it can do amazing things.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interactive-fiction-if-tools">Interactive Fiction (IF) Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.davidkinder.co.uk/frotz.html">Windows Frotz</a>: My favorite Z-machine interpreter. If you play interactive fiction games or know what Infocom games are, you probably already know what this is.  This supports all the various Infocom formats: zip, dat, z5, z8, etc., including z6.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.adamdawes.com/windows8/win8_frotz8.html">Frotz8</a> is a native Windows app based on the frotz interpreter that supports touch screens, and it has handy integration with the IF Archive.  It appears to be stagnant since 2013, so I’m not expecting anything new.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/lectrote">Lectrote</a>: This is my current choice for a multi-format interpreter that handles more than just Z machine files, and while it’s the new kid on the block, it has novel features like autosave.  It looks really nice to me (great fonts and themes), but it uses ZVM as the Z interpreter, so it only supports Z3, Z4, Z5, &amp; Z8.  Other format support includes Glulx, Hugo, TADS, and Ink.  This seems to be under active development, so we’ll see where it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/">Gargoyle</a> deserves a mention because it supports every format I’ve ever run across because it is basically just a wrapper for a number of interpreters. The default (and excellent)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://cspiegel.github.io/bocfel/">Bocfel</a> Z machine interpreter has partial support for z6 files too.  Its other claim to fame is its focus on good typesetting, which is a really interesting niche.  But be warned, it essentially has no user interface, so you need to edit a text file to change fonts and whatnot.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://maher.filfre.net/filfre/index.html">Filfre</a>: This is easier to use than Gargoyle for sure, so I’m mentioning it here, but it has minimal customization options.  You might want to choose this if you need Glulx support and want an interface similar to Windows Frotz.  It’s probably not the best choice for Z-Machine files because it only supports versions 3, 4, 5, and 8 story files. The project has been stagnant since 2013, so what you see is what you get.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.trizbort.com/">Trizbort</a>: If you play IF games, you know mapping is essential, and Trizbort helps you do that.  There is even an automap function that works pretty well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Just for easy reference, here are some websites to find and download some great IF stories to use with the interpreters:</p>
