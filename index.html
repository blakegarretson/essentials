        <p><strong>Welcome to my carefully curated list of the best free
        programs for MacOS, Windows, and Linux!</strong></p>
        <p>This is the free software that I find essential when working
        on a desktop or laptop. These are the programs that I either
        immediately install when I set up a new computer, or I end up
        installing as I need them. In most instances I have tried a
        number of solutions before choosing one that I like the most. I
        maintain this list for my own convenience so I can quickly
        remind myself of (and find) all the software that I thought was
        best the last time I evaluated a category.</p>
        <p>Many of these programs are cross-platform, but if an app
        doesn’t support at least Windows and Mac I will make a note of
        that and usually list alternatives. All of these programs are
        free for personal use, and many (if not most) are open-source as
        well. If there are commercial versions available for a program,
        the free version listed here is not a time-limited trial, and it
        is useful without upgrading to a paid version. In some cases I
        have listed alternatives, honorable mentions, or close seconds.
        Having said that, I try not to include redundant programs unless
        they bring something to the party. Likewise, I won’t bother
        listing software included with the operating systems since you
        already have them (e.g. Apple Notes or Safari).</p>
        <p>Have a suggestion for a great program that should be on my
        list? Let me know about it! Have a comment or correction on
        something on this website? Click on the <a
        href="https://forms.gle/swSCivmLBwTxRwY27">Feedback</a> link and
        let me know!</p>
        <h1 id="graphics-video">Graphics &amp; Video</h1>
        <h2 id="video-player">Video Player</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a>: Cross-platform
        video player for nearly any format imaginable. Especially useful
        for when you need to do uncommon things like adjust
        audio/Bluetooth sync or load custom subtitles. The interface
        isn’t fancy, but it has the features you need (and many you
        don’t) and stays out of your way.</li>
        <li><a href="https://iina.io/">IINA</a>: While VLC works great
        on any platform, Mac users may prefer IINA. It’s a full-fledged
        media player with a clean interface and features like
        picture-in-picture mode and built-in subtitle downloading. If
        I’m on a Mac, I’m using IINA over VLC 99% of the time.
        <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        <li><a
        href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-streaming-browser/id553245401?mt=12">Friendly
        Streaming Browser</a> is a weird name for a cool app. It’s just
        a front end for various streaming services (YouTube, Netflix,
        etc.), but it excels at multitasking by offering a
        Picture-In-Picture mode. I didn’t realize I needed this until I
        tried it. This is what you want when you’re working on something
        and need an easy way to play a 4-hour instrumental playlist from
        YouTube in the background, or maybe you’re editing photos or
        something, and you want to watch a mindless episode of a cooking
        show in a tiny window at the corner of your screen.
        <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="photoimage-editor">Photo/Image Editor</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>: Robust image editor
        similar to Photoshop. It might not be appropriate for a casual
        user who just wants to crop some photos, but it’s not really
        suited for DTP pros either since it’s missing native CMYK
        support. Having said that, if you’re doing non-print stuff, it
        will almost certainly get the job done if you have the patience
        to learn the tool. Bonus: the scripting allows for complex
        plugins and automation.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html">Paint.NET</a>
        is a fantastic alternative to GIMP for those weary of the
        learning curve (or the name). It is less powerful than GIMP, but
        it’s easy to use and really polished. It’s the Paint program
        Microsoft should have shipped with Windows.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="photo-managementviewing-and-casual-editing">Photo
        Management/Viewing (and Casual Editing)</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://x.photoscape.org/">Photoscape X</a>: Great
        program for photo viewing and basic touch-up. It makes it easy
        to do common tasks like cropping to standard sizes and removing
        red-eye. There is a Pro version with extra features, but the
        free version boasts a truly impressive feature set that is more
        than enough for most people. If you buy the Pro version it’s
        because you like it so much, not because you felt forced into it
        because the free version was so crippled.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="also-check-out">Also check out:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>If the Photoscape X workflow doesn’t agree with you, my
        runner up is <a
        href="https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/">XnView MP</a>. It has
        an old school interface with simple controls that may be more
        intuitive for some people. It has all the essential functions
        and more.</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://www.faststone.org/FSViewerDetail.htm">FastStone
        Image Viewer</a> is a fantastic photo viewer with a truly
        impressive set of editing features. After Google retired their
        Picasa software I used FastStone for about a year, but I just
        couldn’t get on board with the (for me) unintuitive interface,
        and I ended up switching to something else. While it didn’t work
        out for me, it might be perfect for you.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        <li>If all you need is a super-fast, image viewer (that
        incidentally has some robust editing features), look no further
        than <a href="https://www.irfanview.com/">IrfanView</a>. I
        started using it in the late 1990s, and it is still going
        strong. This is a great program to make your default action when
        clicking on JPEGs, GIFs, and PNGs.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="image-processingworkflow">Image Processing/Workflow</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.darktable.org/">darktable</a>: If you
        work with RAW photo files or want to get the most out of your
        photos, you need a non-destructive post-production software like
        darktable. This isn’t about “photoshopping” a picture; instead
        it’s all about histograms, levels, curves, sharpening, colors,
        lens correction, noise, etc.
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.rawtherapee.com/">RawTherapee</a> is
        another app worth having in your toolbox. While it seems to me
        that darktable is overall the better option, RawTherapee has a
        few features/functions that I think are superior, so I like
        having both installed.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="vector-image-editor">Vector Image Editor</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a>: Incredibly
        capable vector image editor for creating professional quality,
        scalable diagrams, logos, you-name-it. Its functionality rivals
        Adobe Illustrator, although sometimes the tools don’t map
        one-to-one.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="digital-sketchingpainting">Digital
        Sketching/Painting</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a> is fantastic
        digital painting software. If you’re into illustration or
        digital painting, it has what you need. Krita has plenty of
        great features, but one thing that stands out to me is that it
        comes with a large selection of high quality brushes that are
        excellent. Personally, I have moved my digital painting to an
        iPad, so I’m not using Krita much these days, but I still would
        recommend it for desktop use.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="stable-diffusion-ai-image-generation">Stable Diffusion
        AI Image Generation</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://drawthings.ai/">Draw Things</a> is the
        easiest to install and use AI image generator on Mac. One-click
        install, download a few models, and you’re in business. It
        handles inpainting/outpainting without the user even having to
        know what that means. Having said that, the current state of AI
        means you have to know a bit of jargon and whatnot before you
        can really use this tool, but the toolset is robust, the in-app
        help is decent, and the results are excellent even running on a
        M1 Mac Mini. AI is a rapidly changing landscape, and the
        developer is keeping up and adding impressive features at a fast
        pace. <strong>(Mac)</strong>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://diffusionbee.com/">Diffusion Bee</a> is the
        other “beginners” AI program that is easy to install. It isn’t
        as good as Draw Things at the moment, but it is certainly worth
        an honorable mention. There is a Windows version in the works,
        which will probably quickly make it the easiest way to run
        Stable Diffusion on Windows. <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a
        href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI">ComfyUI</a> is
        probably the closest thing we have to a “one-click” install of
        Stable Diffusion on Windows so far. Just download it, extract
        the archive, and put your models in place. There are lots of web
        interfaces to Stable Diffusion, but many of them are harder to
        install and configure.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="screenshotsscreen-capture">Screenshots/Screen
        Capture</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://getsharex.com/">ShareX</a>: You don’t know
        how useful a good screenshot tool is until you start using it.
        It’s really handy to automatically save screenshots (or portions
        of screens) to a predetermined folder and keep it on the
        clipboard as well. ShareX takes it one step further and will
        upload the image to pretty much any site you like, and the OCR
        functionality is really cool. The icing on the cake is the
        screen capture capability that will let you record portions of
        your screen and save it to a GIF (or other formats). It’s great
        for playing tech support with family to show them how to do
        stuff. <strong>(Windows)</strong>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://getgreenshot.org/">Greenshot</a> was my old
        favorite, and you may want to use it if ShareX is confusing or
        seems like overkill.</li>
        <li>It’s worth noting that recent versions of Windows 10 now
        come with a tool called “Snip &amp; Sketch” that does something
        similar (use <em>SHIFT + WINDOWS + S</em> key combo to access
        it), although it doesn’t automatically save the image to a
        file.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="https://shottr.cc/">Shottr</a> is an amazing tool
        for screenshots on Mac. It has all the usual features plus cool
        stuff like scrolling captures (for long webpages) and OCR text
        recognition so you can cut and paste text from images on your
        screen. <strong>(Mac)</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>If you don’t need/use anything beyond simple screenshots on
        Mac, it’s worth mentioning the <em>SHIFT + CMD + 4</em> shortcut
        gets you a portion of the screen and automatically saves the
        file to the desktop.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="live-streaming">Live Streaming</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a> is a solid
        choice for live streaming because of the massive feature list,
        but it can be pretty overwhelming for a beginner. The price is
        right though (free), so it’s worth the learning curve.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="video-conversion">Video Conversion</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://handbrake.fr/">HandBrake</a>: Convert video
        from/to nearly any format. While incredibly powerful and
        complex, HandBrake makes it really simple to get started. If you
        don’t want anything special, just drag and drop a file, select a
        preset target format (e.g. Roku 1080p30 or Android 720p30), and
        hit start.
        <ul>
        <li>On Windows if you want to convert your DVD library, you’ll
        need to put the <a
        href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/libdvdcss/1.2.11/win64/libdvdcss-2.dll">libdvdcss</a>
        library in the Handbrake directory.</li>
        <li>If Handbrake is too confusing and all you want to do is rip
        a DVD, <a href="http://www.makemkv.com/">MakeMKV</a> rips and
        decodes DVDs (even with copy protection). It just isn’t as
        versatile as Handbrake.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="https://sindresorhus.com/gifski">Gifski</a> is a
        super easy way to convert video to high-quality GIFs.
        <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="video-editing">Video Editing</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.openshot.org/">Openshot</a>: is a
        capable multi-track editor with a nice interface that is fairly
        intuitive compared to other apps in this space. If I don’t need
        anything special, this is the first place I reach. Feature-wise,
        it seems like it falls right between Shotcut and kdevlive, but I
        have run into weird bugs that can be annoying. Having said that,
        one feature I especially enjoy is the captioning support which
        includes some great appearance customization. I initially
        started using Openshot because iMovie was so limited in video
        formats and aspect ratios, and I quickly discovered Openshot is
        more capable in a dozen other ways as well. I don’t even bother
        with iMovie anymore.</li>
        <li><a href="https://kdenlive.org/">kdenlive</a>: If you do need
        something special that Openshot can’t handle, it’s great to have
        kdenlive in the toolbox. Openshot has it beat in a few areas, so
        I still prefer it in general, but kdenlive has some features
        that make it worth having around.</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut">LosslessCut</a> is a
        lossless video editor that doesn’t require reencoding the entire
        video for simple operations. This is a great option if you just
        need to trim or cut out a section from a video file.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="also-check-out-1">Also check out:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/">DaVinci
        Resolve</a>: This is a professional package, but they have a
        free version that’s very impressive. It outshines the above
        editors in features, but I’m reluctant to learn a free tool that
        could be retracted at a whim, so in general the open source
        tools get my vote.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.shotcut.org/">Shotcut</a> should at
        least be on your radar, and perhaps you find it to your liking
        more than Openshot, but it’s limited functionality (especially
        subtitles/captioning) and steeper learning curve make it hard to
        recommend over the other options.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="animation">Animation</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>: 3D modeling
        and animation. Has more power than I have skill, but other
        people do really cool things with it. It’s fun to play with
        though and is worth the download.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.synfig.org/">Synfig Studio</a>: Nice 2D
        animation package. I dabble with projects, and when I do, this
        works for me. It’s simple and intuitive for the level of
        projects I make.
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://opentoonz.github.io/e/">OpenToonz</a> is
        really cool 2D animation software that’s most well-known for
        being used by Studio Ghibli and Futurama. It is possible that
        OpenToonz is better than Synfig, but I don’t do enough animation
        to know the difference, and OpenToonz is less intuitive to
        me.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="media-server">Media Server</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://plex.tv/">Plex</a>: My reluctant choice for
        the best personal media server for most people. This is what you
        want for steaming your media to your Roku, Fire Stick, smart TV,
        etc. Just tell Plex where you store your movies, TV shows, and
        music and it will do the rest, including downloading cover art
        and show descriptions. My main reservation is they are
        monetizing the service more, and the free features feel sparse.
        For instance, you need a “Plex Pass” subscription to download
        shows to your client device for offline viewing. However,
        presently the core functionality is still free, and the easy
        setup and overall user experience is still worth giving Plex a
        try.</li>
        <li><a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> is the more
        consumer-friendly, open-source alternative to Plex. Setup is
        fairly simple, although you may need to add some plugins to get
        all the functionality you want. Otherwise, it’s a fine
        alternative and arguably better than Plex in some regards. I
        would recommend trying Jellyfin first if you are more tech
        savvy. There are Jellyfin clients on every platform as well, so
        streaming to any device is easy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="comic-reader">Comic Reader</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.yacreader.com/">YACReader</a> is
        actually two programs in one. It comes with an excellent comic
        reader and a comics library browser. It reads every popular
        format (cbr, cbz, cb7, pdf, etc.), and it has all the features I
        need, and quite a few I don’t. Works equally well on Windows,
        Mac, and Linux, which is handy so I can use the same solution
        everywhere.</li>

        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://getmusicbee.com/">MusicBee</a>: A great way
        to organize and play your local music library. Includes handy
        features like gapless playback and auto-tagging. An app like
        this is has become mostly obsolete since I’ve moved to streaming
        services like Spotify, but when I do want to work with local
        music files, it’s hard to do better than MusicBee.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>I’m not listing a Mac alternative for playback here because
        the default Apple Music app meets my meager needs.</li>

        <li><a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz
        Picard</a> is the best cross-platform solution for identifying
        and organizing a large collection of music files. It can figure
        out what files are based on tags and even audio fingerprints.
        Besides tagging it will rename and move files as well. Even if
        you’re using Apple Music or MusicBee to organize your music
        library, this is still a handy tool to clean up the incorrectly
        tagged files before adding them to your library.
        <ul>
        <li>If Picard isn’t to your liking, I would suggest <a
        href="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/">MP3Tag</a> . It is a universal
        batch tag editor that handles MP3s along with every other
        popular audio format. The robust file renaming/retagging tools
        and online database lookups make this powerful option for
        cleaning up your audio collection. This is only free for
        Windows. It’s a paid app on the Mac App Store.

        mixing, to filters and effects, Audacity has you covered. Just
        keep in mind this isn’t a full-blown DAW, so don’t expect
        non-destructive mixing and whatnot.
        <ul>
        <li>A simple single-track alternative to Audacity is <a
        href="http://www.audiodope.org/">AudioDope</a> . If you just

        This used to be a commercial DAW that is now free as of 2018.
        It’s a rebranded version of SONAR Platinum, and it’s incredibly
        powerful. This is a great place to start if you want to make
        some music. <strong>(Windows)</strong>

        <li>Another great DAW is <a
        href="https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform-free">Waveform

        free version has no limitations and is very capable.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="https://ardour.org/">Ardour</a> is worth checking
        out if you’re a Linux user. It does all the basics really well.
        From recording audio or MIDI, to editing, to mixing, you’re
        covered. The only trick is if you really want it for free, you
        should use your distribution’s packager manager and don’t
        download it from the website.
        <ul>
        <li>You may be asking why I limit my Ardour recommendation to
        Linux users. The simple answer is on Windows and Mac it isn’t
        really “free”. While it is open source and you can build it from
        scratch for free, if you want a convenient, pre-built binary,
        you need to either buy it or pay a subscription. The free/demo
        version goes silent after 10 minutes, which I consider too
        restrictive to still include here on my list of free
        software.<br />

        “sound generation system, synthesizer, beat/baseline editor and
        MIDI control system which can power an entire home studio”. I’d
        call it a nice step sequencer with VST and SoundFont support for
        creating music. I wouldn’t call it a DAW because it doesn’t
        record multitrack audio, but combined with Audacity, you can
        make some cool stuff. Honestly, I wouldn’t even list LMMS now
        that Cakewalk is free, except LMMS is open source, and Cakewalk
        may go away sometime in the future.</li>

        <h2 id="all-purpose-text-editors">All-Purpose Text Editors</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is
        easy to recommend for general text editing and quick file edits
        on Windows simply because it is blazing fast and the interface
        stays out of your way. This is my default application for text
        files, and over the years I’ve written many thousands of lines
        of code in Notepad++. Having said that, the antiquated syntax
        coloring system and somewhat clunky customization limits how
        well it scales to many tasks. But it is still a fast editor and
        it shines when opening a 1 GB log file… as long as it doesn’t
        need to be syntax colored as well.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        <li><a href="https://coteditor.com/">CotEditor</a> is my
        favorite text editor on a Mac for quick and easy text editing.
        It isn’t as well known as other editors, but it is fast and
        capable. It isn’t trying to be an IDE, so don’t expect too much,
        but the amount of customization and the total feature set is
        fantastic. It has an inspired and flexible scripting interface
        which lets you write plugins in Python, bash, Applescript, and
        several other languages. And did I mention it was fast?? This is
        a great choice for your default text file handler.
        <strong>(Mac)</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>If CotEditor is too barebones for you, the next step up
        without going to an IDE is <a
        href="https://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> . It opens slower
        than CotEditor, but it has some robust functionality including
        an impressive array of text manipulation tools and extensive
        language support with syntax highlighting, while still staying
        fairly lightweight. <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>: <code>vi</code> was
        a legendary, powerful keyboard-based text editor with a steep
        learning curve, Vim is its most successful clone (itself being a
        derivative of Stevie), and Neovim aims at pushing Vim into the
        21st century with a clean code base and features like Lua
        extensibility and asynchronous plugins which allow for things
        like async linters. Some people think it’s silly to use a
        <code>vi</code> clone more than four decades after it was
        introduced, but there are some tasks that are orders of
        magnitude faster in a <code>vi</code> clone than modern
        mouse-oriented text editors.
        <ul>
        <li>If a console-based text editor is what you need and you
        don’t love the <code>vi</code> modal editing and key bindings,
        you should really check out <a
        href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a>. Micro works
        from a console, but it has modern capabilities like mouse
        support, multiple cursors, Lua plugins, tabs, tmux-like splits,
        and syntax color schemes. Best of all, the normal Windows key
        bindings like CTRL-C, CTRL-V, CTRL-S, and CTRL-Z work as
        expected.</li>

        <h3 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> is a
        fast, clean, good looking editor, and it gets points for
        popularizing (if not actually inventing) the command palette and
        document map (and maybe even multiple cursors?), but I want to
        like it more than I actually do. Maybe I’m just too old to learn
        new key bindings? You should check it out though. Sublime is
        truly excellent software. The real reason it’s just an honorable
        mention is it technically doesn’t meet my criteria for this
        website as “free”. You can evaluate Sublime Text for free with
        no feature limitations or time limits, but you should pay if you
        continue to use it.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a> is a
        jack-of-all-trades that is good at everything, but not
        best-in-class in anything. It is a versatile cross-platform
        programmer’s text editor that you can configure to be anything
        from a simple Notepad.exe replacement to an ultra-lightweight
        IDE. It’s just hard to recommend because while it’s good for
        quick edits and opening text files, Notepad++ or CotEditor are
        even faster for those quick tasks. And while Geany is really
        nice for light coding, VS Code is even better. Geany is rarely
        the best tool for the job, but it might be the right choice for
        a computer that just needs an all-purpose, do-it-all editor. If
        you do try it, there are lots of great features hidden in the
        official plugin package, so be sure to grab it as well.</li>

        <h2 id="writingmarkdown-apps">Writing/Markdown Apps</h2>

        long-form prose like papers, articles, essays, or even books.
        I’m only including Markdown editors here as I think that’s just
        a standard requirement for me at this point.</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is probably best
        known as a note-taking app, but it has comprehensive Markdown
        support and a plugin ecosystem that can turn it into just about
        anything you want. I think Obsidian is great for writing after
        installing plugins to support <a
        href="https://languagetool.org">LanguageTool</a>, smart quotes,
        and Git (for document version control.) The live-preview hides
        the Markdown syntax if you prefer that, and you can see math
        blocks and diagrams render as you type.</li>
        <li><a href="https://zettlr.com">Zettlr</a> advertises itself as
        a “one-stop publication workbench”, and that’s an apt
        description. While excellent for notes, it handles long projects
        without breaking a sweat, especially if you need to handle
        citations. Like Obsidian, it has a very nice live-preview which
        I find mandatory for a modern writing app.</li>

        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://desairem.com/wordpress/ufocus/">uFocus</a>
        is a lightweight distraction-free editor for the Mac. Its
        Markdown support and clean interface make it a perfect choice
        for quick prose writing. Even though it is simple, there are
        plenty of customization options to make it work and look just
        like you want it to. It’s a wonderful app if you don’t need
        live-preview. <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        <li><a href="http://writemonkey.com/">WriteMonkey</a> is a
        distraction-free text editor with a few handy features that
        pushed it to the front of the pack back when distraction-free
        editors were new and all the rage. Its development has slowed
        down (stopped??), but it still works fine even if it feels a bit
        outdated at this point. <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        <li><a
        href="https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit">MarkEdit</a>
        reminds me more of a code editor that supports Markdown than a
        modern writing app, but it is excellent at being a “Markdown
        code editor”. There is no in-app rendering, but the syntax
        highlighting is helpful. <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/marktext/marktext">MarkText</a>
        is a cross–platform option that I probably would have included
        as one of my first choices due to its excellent live-preview and
        intuitive interface, but development seems to have stopped, so I
        question its longevity. MarkText looks like a clone of Typora (a
        paid app), so if you like Typora, you may prefer the free
        MarkText instead.</li>

        <h2 id="note-taking">Note-Taking</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.onenote.com/download">OneNote</a> is
        easy to recommend given the comprehensive functionality and the
        fact that it is free. For most tasks, I’m a plain text file guy.
        However, I use OneNote at work extensively, and I really like
        it. I can integrate emails, pictures, tables, and all the rest
        into a workflow organized by notebooks, sections, and pages.
        However, if you don’t use Office 365 and/or Outlook, OneNote
        might not have as many advantages for you.</li>
        <li><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is listed above
        in the general writing app category, but it is great for notes
        as well. Images and tables are supported through Markdown, so
        they aren’t as easy to include as in OneNote, but Obsidian
        excels when it comes to text. The Canvas feature is also really
        cool. It lets you visualize and connect data in interesting
        ways, a bit like a mind mapper. Obsidian’s biggest shortcoming
        is you have to figure out your own file-sync solution unless you
        pay them for their sync service. Saving your vaults to Google
        Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, etc. will solve this for you, but you
        still won’t be able to work with some combinations (like saving
        a vault to Google Drive on desktop and opening it on an iPhone).
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://zettlr.com">Zettlr</a> (also mentioned
        above with the writing apps) is a Markdown-based app great for
        note-taking, and (unlike Obsidian) it is completely open source.
        While powerful on the desktop, Zettlr does not have a mobile app
        counterpart, so your notes aren’t easily accessible on your
        mobile devices. You are also on your own for syncing, but that
        is easily overcome by saving your notes to a cloud service like
        Google Drive or iCloud. Unless open source is incredibly
        important to you, I would still recommend Obsidian over
        Zettlr.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="https://tot.rocks/">Tot</a> is a Mac-only app that
        sits in your menubar waiting to save quick notes and snippets of
        text. This is not a general purpose notes app like the above
        apps. It is very limited, and it just has seven
        Markdown-supported “pages” of notes where you can type or paste
        whatever you like. This weird limitation carves out a unique
        use-case that I didn’t know I needed until I started using it.
        As a bonus, syncing is automatic and seamless, so if you install
        Tot on a laptop and desktop (for instance), it serves as a
        common clipboard where you can pass information.

        Git.
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a>: WinMerge has
        been around for a long time, and it’s still one of the best

        support, as well as interesting features like integrated
        mind-mapping that generates graphics representations from
        Markdown hierarchy. My main complaint is that it doesn’t have
        global hotkey support, so actually <em>using</em> the snippets
        can be tedious and harder than it should be.</li>

        scratchpad that provides a large host of text manipulations
        useful for programming or writing. You paste in your text, and
        then run a script on it. It can be anything you can think of,
        like running it through ROT13, trimming whitespace, hashing it,
        html encode/decode, sorting, removing duplicate lines,
        converting cases, or tons of other operations. If you don’t see

        years and many of the tools require you to upgrade for access to
        the premium features. Pro-tip: the mark-up/annotation
        capabilities are hidden under View➞Tools➞Comment .

        <li>For a lighter-weight solution to reading and marking up PDFs
        on Mac, it’s hard to beat <a
        href="https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/">Skim</a>. While being
        fast and free, it is still has plenty of features.

        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>: All-in-one
        ebook manager. Whatever you need to do to/with an ebook, this
        will do it. It organizes, converts, downloads covers, etc..
        Absolutely indispensable if you have a non-DRM ebook collection.
        With plug-ins you can even strip DRM to backup your
        purchases.</li>
        <li><a href="https://fbreader.org">FBReader</a> is a
        cross-platform ebook reader with a nice clean interface that
        stays out of the way. It’s simple, but it still has all the
        customization you need to make it look exactly how you like it .
        The real killer feature is the “book network”. It uses your
        Google Drive to store books and sync progress and bookmarks
        across platforms. If you read from multiple devices, this is a
        huge bonus.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.turnipsoft.co.uk/freda/">Freda</a>: A
        nice standalone e-reader that handles the popular formats like
        mobi and ePub. The main advantage it has over Calibre’s built-in
        reader is the extensive customization options and font
        rendering. <strong>(Windows)</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>The honorable mention on Windows goes to <a
        href="https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html">Sumatra
        PDF</a> because it is a convenient all-in-one reader for PDF,
        EPUB, MOBI, CBR, CBZ, CHM, and XPS. While Sumatra might not be
        the best solution for ebooks or comics, it’s handy to have
        around, and some books even look better in Sumatra (usually
        because of font rendering). <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>

        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>: Convert markup
        formats to other formats. Handles Markdown, HTML, EPUB, LaTeX,
        etc. This is an extremely powerful program, and I like to use it
        to build websites through the use of its robust template
        system.</li>

        <h2 id="texlatex-tools">TeX/LaTeX Tools</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://miktex.org/">MiKTeX</a>: A port of the TeX
        document publishing system that converts source files into
        beautifully typeset documents. If you know what TeX/LaTeX are,
        you need this. If you don’t know what they are, and you care
        about breathtaking documents, then you need to learn TeX. The
        main advantage MiKTeX has over other TeX distributions like <a
        href="https://tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a> (the <em>de
        facto</em> standard TeX system for Unix-like systems) is that it
        downloads packages on-the-fly as needed and streamlines
        installation and updates.
        <ul>
        <li>This isn’t a software link, but a really useful site about
        LaTeX fonts is <a
        href="http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/">here</a>. And while I’m
        breaking the rules and posting web links, <a
        href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/">here’s</a> a really
        good website for LaTeX info.</li>
        <li>The two other MiKTeX alternatives that I want to note are <a
        href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html">MacTeX</a>,
        which is a Mac-only distribution of <a
        href="https://tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>, and <a
        href="https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/">Tectonic</a>,
        which is a modern TeX/LaTeX engine that has some cool tricks,
        including on-demand automatic package installation. Tectonic is
        not a bad place to start if you have never used TeX before.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/">TeXstudio</a>:
        Lightweight portable LaTeX IDE, including editor, spell checker,
        and symbol toolbars. For those keeping track, this was forked
        from TeXMaker back in 2009, and it’s clearly outpaced it. If I
        need to edit TeX, this is a nice solution.
        <ul>
        <li>While I love TeX, unless I’m writing a technical paper with
        extensive math notation or formatting requirements, I’m probably
        going to use a Markdown editor that supports TeX math blocks
        instead of a dedicated TeX editor.</li>
        <li>Another nice alternative is to just use VS Code with the
        appropriate LaTeX extensions installed.</li>
        </ul></li>

        <h2 id="office-suite">Office Suite</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>:
        Provides all the usual “office” suspects, like a word processor,
        spreadsheet, and presentation applications. While still lacking
        the polish of MS Office, for most use cases this is a reasonable
        replacement. The key functionality is there, and the major gaps
        of the early releases (e.g. Goal Seek and Pivot Tables) have
        long since been filled. Worth noting: LibreOffice Draw works
        well for flowcharts (similar to Visio).
        <ul>
        <li>Full disclosure, I don’t find LibreOffice essential in the
        sense that I use it often. I like LibreOffice as a convenience
        so I can easily open an MS Office file or perform the odd task,
        but I actually far prefer working in the cloud with Google Docs
        and Sheets. In some ways, Sheets is even better than Excel or
        LibreOffice Calc with conveniences like the split()
        function.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="desktop-publishing">Desktop Publishing</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a> is the best
        free desktop publishing solution out there; perfect for making
        flyers, invitations, banners, stationary, and even full books.
        When a casual user needs something more than Word, but can’t
        justify buying something like Adobe InDesign, Scribus is
        probably your best option.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="sheet-music">Sheet Music</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://musescore.org/en">MuseScore</a>:
        Easy-to-use interface for creating sheet music. With great
        documentation and abundant resources like videos, tutorials, and
        how-tos, you will be creating great looking sheet music
        documents in no time.
        <ul>
        <li>If you want to make sheet music and have complete control
        over every aspect of the output, <a
        href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a> is where it’s at.
        There’s no GUI, it’s super niche software, so it’s not for
        everyone, but the results are sublime.</li>
        </ul></li>

        <h2 id="web-browser">Web Browser</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>
        is a great choice for your default web browser. The robust
        feature set and impressive array of extensions make it easy to
        recommend. It’s arguably far more pro-consumer than Chrome with
        its stance on ad-blockers.
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>
        should get a mention since it was my default browser from 2008
        until 2024. Its most recent policy on ad-blockers was a deal
        breaker for me, and I left to try other options.</li>
        <li>If customization is important to you, <a
        href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> may be of interest. It’s
        doing some cool things and even integrates features like an RSS
        reader.</li>
        <li>And because you can never have too many browsers, the <a
        href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> browser is another
        nice option if privacy and security are a high priority.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="remote-shell-access">Remote Shell Access</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>:
        Awesome ssh/telnet client. It’s been the premier free terminal
        client for so many years because it’s simple and works while not
        skimping on features. <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        <li><a href="https://tabby.sh/">Tabby</a> is the only client
        that has ever tempted me away from Putty. At first it doesn’t
        seem as full-featured, but keep digging and you’ll see all the
        SSH options you need in a really customizable terminal,
        including built-in SFTP and cross-platform support. If I’m on a
        Mac, this is my chosen SSH client. Tabby also makes a wonderful
        terminal for local shells.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="file-transfer">File Transfer</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a>: Great
        ftp/sftp/scp client with lots of extra features like bandwidth
        limiting and shutting down the program or computer after file
        transfers are done. <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        <li><a href="https://portx.online/en/">PortX</a> is a simple,
        bare-bones cross-platform option if you want to transfer files
        over SFTP or even Amazon S3 or Google Cloud storage. It’s also a
        ssh client, but I don’t typically use it for that since the
        customization is limited. This is what I generally use on a Mac
        since WinSCP is Windows only.
        <ul>
        <li>If you need more features than PortX, <a
        href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a> is a fantastic
        alternative that supports a ton of protocols. While it is free,
        the main drawback is you will see a nag screen asking for a
        donation every time you close the program.</li>
        <li>My go-to ftp/scp solution for many years was <a
        href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FIleZilla</a>. It’s
        cross-platform and it worked great. The problem is they did some
        shady stuff years ago with their installer in an attempt to
        monetize the software. You would try to install FileZilla, and
        the next thing you knew you had McAfee installed too. Since
        then, they aren’t bundling bloatware with FileZilla anymore, and
        they are offering a Pro version with extra features instead. I
        have used FileZilla more recently, and it’s still a decent
        choice.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a>:
        Lightweight, yet powerful, BitTorrent client. There’s no ads and
        the features are all there. If you need a standalone BitTorrent
        client, this is a great place to start.</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui">Transmission
        Remote GUI</a> is the perfect companion to <a
        href="https://transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a>. This is
        really the best choice for when you want to remote control a
        Transmission session running on a server. This is handy if you
        have a torrent box and you just want to add/monitor torrents
        from another computer. So to be clear, you would need to run
        Transmission on the server/torrent box and Transmission Remote
        GUI runs on your desktop/laptop.
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="https://github.com/tympanix/Electorrent">Electorrent</a>
        is the a great alternative when you want a nice, clean-looking
        client with a modern UI to manage your torrents remotely. It
        isn’t overly complicated, it supports all the popular torrent
        backends, and it has all the usual functionality that you want
        without overwhelming you with options.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="https://soduto.com/">Soduto</a> makes it easier to
        for your Mac to interact with your Linux and Android devices.
        Similar to AirDrop, you can share files between systems, but you
        can also share clipboards and even send SMS messages from your
        Mac through your Android phone. <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="remote-desktop-control">Remote Desktop Control</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://remotedesktop.google.com/">Chrome Remote
        Desktop</a>: For the simplicity, it’s hard to beat this solution
        to remote access and support. It makes it easy to check
        something on my desktop computer while I’m away from the house,
        and it’s also handy if you are the “IT Guy” for your friends and
        family. They can set this up pretty easily and share their
        screen with you so you can fix their issue.</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://www.uvnc.com/downloads/ultravnc.html">UltraVNC</a>:
        If you need full-blown, full-featured remote desktop control,
        UltraVNC will do the job fine. I just don’t find myself using
        VNC as much as I used to as I move more data to the cloud. This
        is a more cumbersome solution because it requires
        port-forwarding and either a static IP or a dynamic DNS solution
        to make it useful outside of your home network.
        <strong>(Windows)</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>I’m not listing a VNC client for Mac because it has a VNC
        client built in. Search for “Screen Sharing.app” in Spotlight to
        find it.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="chatmessenging">Chat/Messenging</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a>: The apparent
        <em>de facto</em> standard chat app in the gaming world as well
        as other communities. I have no particular affinity to the app
        itself, but it works fine on both desktop and mobile, and there
        are some cool communities that made their home on Discord. Of
        particular note is that Discord has become the “new IRC” for
        many programming communities.
        <ul>
        <li>Speaking of IRC, I have a hard time calling an IRC client
        “essential” because it’s become such a niche protocol at this
        point, but there are still some useful dev communities out
        there. So if you do need IRC, check out <a
        href="https://hexchat.github.io/">HexChat</a> on Windows and
        Linux and <a href="http://limechat.net/mac/">LimeChat</a> on
        Mac.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="honorable-mentions-2">Honorable Mentions</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://desktop.telegram.org/">Telegram</a>: I
        really don’t need another chat protocol in my life, but Telegram
        is doing some things right like real cross-platform support/sync
        and no size restrictions when sharing media or documents. It’s a
        polished experience, and features like group voice chat work
        exceptionally well.</li>
        <li>If privacy or security is paramount to you, then <a
        href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> has Telegram beat. In
        Telegram, end-to-end encryption is only optional, and you can’t
        encrypt group chats. Signal fixes those shortcomings, but falls
        short of Telegram in other areas.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="ipport-scanner">IP/Port Scanner</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://angryip.org/">Angry IP Scanner</a> is the
        cross-platform solution I reach for when I need to find out
        what’s on my local network. You get IPs, hostnames, open ports,
        MACs, vendors, and more. The default settings out of the box
        aren’t great for my uses, but I can configure it to be exactly
        what I need. For instance, some of the results are hidden by
        default, so I configure the “fetchers” to include vendors, and I
        like to hide all the IPs except the ones that respond to ping,
        and I scan more ports (like 445, 20-23).</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="programming">Programming</h1>
        <h2 id="programming-editoride">Programming Editor/IDE</h2>
        <p><em>Note: See the <a
        href="#all-purpose-text-editors">All-Purpose Text Editors</a>
        section for other text editors useful for programming.</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio
        Code</a>: VS Code is a legitimately great editor for just about
        any language. From linter to debugging, everything you need can
        be integrated into a seamless workflow. Check out the extensions
        to add nearly any functionality you could want, turning VS Code
        into a legitimate IDE. A huge bonus is the excellent Jupyter
        Notebook support. For many use cases, there’s no reason to run a
        standalone Jupyter server anymore. (Note: Don’t confuse VS Code
        with <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual
        Studio</a> which is a full-blown IDE with more advanced features
        that I don’t find necessary for the hobbyist.)
        <ul>
        <li>Two things worth mentioning: First, you can run VS Code
        directly in a web browser <a
        href="https://vscode.dev/">here</a>. The experience is pretty
        incredible all things considered. Second, VS Code is very
        actively developed, so if you want the latest and greatest, you
        may want to run <a
        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/">VS Code
        Insiders</a>. On paper it is a beta version of VS Code where the
        new features are tested out, except I have found Insiders to be
        stable enough for production work. I honestly haven’t noticed a
        difference in reliability.</li>
        <li><a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a> is another code editor
        that I’m keeping my eye on. It is a newer offering, but it’s
        already doing some cool things, and it seems to be faster than
        VS Code for those quick code edits. It still has a way to go to
        be competitive with VS Code, but I like where it’s going.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>: A distributed version
        control system that quickly took over the open source world, and
        with good reason. If you’re a programmer, you already know what
        this is. On Windows a big bonus is the installer includes all
        the Unix command-line tools you know and love. If you need ls,
        cat, grep, awk, and all the rest, I think this is the easiest
        way to add them to your Windows system.</li>
        <li><a href="https://gitextensions.github.io/">Git
        Extensions</a>: Sometimes a GUI is convenient to visualize
        branches and handle more complicated tasks when when you don’t
        feel like looking up the correct commands/switches, and I think
        Git Extensions is far superior to the official Git GUI. I wish
        it was cross-platform, but the latest versions are built on .NET
        and Windows only. <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Murmele/Gittyup">Gittyup</a> is
        a good cross-platform option for a Git GUI. On Mac there are
        less options for a good GUI that isn’t proprietary, but this
        works well for me. It makes complex Git operations more
        manageable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="compiled-language">Compiled Language</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>: Even though I don’t do
        a ton of programming in compiled languages anymore, when I do, I
        am usually making command line programs like file utilities,
        text manipulators, number crunching programs, etc, and Go fits
        the bill nicely. With a great standard library and simple
        syntax, Go is great for Python programmers like myself.
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> is the
        heir-apparent to venerable languages like C and C++, and when Go
        isn’t the right tool for the job, Rust often is.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="scripting-language---general-purpose">Scripting Language
        - General Purpose</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>: My favorite
        general purpose programming language. It’s perfect for getting
        the job done quickly without a lot of boilerplate and heavy
        lifting. I’m a pragmatic engineer, so I just want to solve a
        problem as efficiently and elegantly as possible, and I’ll leave

        <li>On Mac I prefer to use <a
        href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> to install the
        various Python versions. Once you install it (which is trivial
        with Homebrew), you can just issue a command like:
        <code>pyenv install 3.10.4</code></li>
        <li>All the essential Python libraries are on PyPi, so here is a
        pip command line (for easy cutting and pasting) useful for STEM
        programming to get you started. This is a short list, but it
        pulls the more important dependencies like scipy, pandas, and
        numpy:
        <code>pip install jupyterlab seaborn PyQt6 sympy</code></li>

        Math/Science</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a>: Just an
        incredible tool for mathematical or scientific computing of any
        kind. The lightweight syntax is a delight even by Python
        standards, and its speed usually matches or beats compiled
        languages due to its JIT compiler and language design. Julia is
        made for speed (both in writing and execution), and I think it
        combines the best of Python, Fortran, MATLAB, and R. I use it
        more as a math tool than a general purpose scripting language,
        hence this separate category.
        <ul>
        <li>For interactive Julia sessions, there is nothing like <a
        href="https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl">Pluto.jl</a> . It is a
        must see experience. It’s like a Jupyter Notebook, but
        better.</li>
        <li>If you like Julia, you might like the <a
        href="https://juliamono.netlify.app/">JuliaMono</a> font. I
        can’t justify listing this with the other fonts below because
        it’s so specific to Julia, but this is an interesting font
        intended to leverage Julia’s excellent Unicode support for
        actual math operations. Check out the website for examples.</li>

        <h2 id="programming-fonts">Programming Fonts</h2>
        <p><em>Below are a few excellent fonts suitable for programming,
        consoles, terminal windows, PuTTY, etc. While just one font
        should be sufficient, I typically have all of these installed as
        one font may look better in a certain terminal or editor, at a
        particular size or scaling, or on a particular monitor.</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/">Dina</a>:
        Great bitmap font in 6, 8, 9, and 10 points with normal, bold,
        italic, and bold/italic faces. I like the 8 and 10 especially
        well. Dina is so clear and crisp on even the worst monitors that
        it is actually pleasurable to read. It’s not really necessary on
        a decent monitor though.</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro">Source
        Code Pro</a>: This font from Adobe looks very clean on high
        resolution monitors. This is just a simple, no frills font
        that’s easy to throw on a random computer to get a decent font
        quickly. Perfect for when the fonts below can be overkill.</li>
        <li><a href="https://input.djr.com/">Input</a>: Incredibly
        flexible font system that lets you customize letters (a/g/i/l/0)
        and symbols (asterisk/braces) to your liking, as well as choose
        from 7 weights and 4 widths, and sans, serif, and mono variants.
        There are 168 styles in all, so you will find one that works for
        any given situation.</li>
        <li><a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/">Iosevka</a>: Similar
        to the Input font, Iosevka raises the bar by adding ligatures,
        more weights, more variants, and incredible character coverage
        with thousands and thousands of supported glyphs. There are
        plenty of variants with different character and symbol styles,
        so you should be able to find one that has the look you want.
        There are so many choices it can be confusing, but if want a
        general purpose font that works everywhere (but doesn’t have
        ligatures), start with the “Iosevka Fixed” font. At the end of
        the day, this is the only font I need because I can configure it
        to look any way I want.</li>

        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.speedcrunch.org/">SpeedCrunch</a> sports
        fast start-up and plenty of functionality. The interface is
        deceptively simple, but lurking under the hood are constants,
        variables, an impressive list of math functions, and equation
        support. Unfortunately, while SpeedCrunch is cross-platform, it
        looks fuzzy/blurry on Mac. The graphics toolkit doesn’t seem to
        upscale well on hi-res monitors, so I just don’t use it on
        Mac.</li>
        <li><a href="https://numi.app/">Numi</a> is one of the best free
        options on Mac for a notebook-stye calculator. The paid version
        supports multiple pages/notebooks, but the free version has full
        functionality otherwise. Intuitive calculations (e.g. “5% of
        20”) and unit conversion (although somewhat basic) make Numi a
        solid desktop calculator. <strong>(Mac)</strong></li>

        <h3 id="scientific">Scientific</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://qalculate.github.io/">Qalculate!</a> is a
        good place to start if you want a scientific calculator on
        Windows or Linux. It can do everything from integration to
        units. The interface is not my favorite, but it is packed with
        features. (Technically this works on Mac too, but with no .app
        or installer, you have to use Homebrew or MacPorts, and there
        isn’t even a shortcut/icon for it, so the experience is
        subpar.)</li>
        <li><a href="https://ncalc-app.web.app/">NCalc</a>: A robust
        scientific calculator for Mac. This has pretty much everything
        you would commonly need in a calculator. There is a Pro upgrade
        that unlocks graphing and other bells and whistles, but it is
        still useful without the upgrade. I actually did end up buying
        the lifetime license for $3.99, which is worth it to me.

        <h3 id="graphing">Graphing</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.geogebra.org/download">GeoGebra</a> is
        an app suite you might want to check out if you need a graphing
        calculator. This suite is five calculators in one, including
        modules for graphing, geometry, algebra, and probability. The
        graphing is fairly robust and the customization is impressive
        for what it is. It’s really great for high school level math or
        maybe even low-level college problems. For higher level math,
        see the real CAS systems below.</li>

        <h2 id="unit-conversion">Unit Conversion</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://convertall.bellz.org/">ConvertAll</a> is
        what you need if you are looking for a flexible, powerful unit
        conversion solution. It really shines at combining fundamental
        units to build more complex units. The interface is a strong
        point. Instead of scrolling through long lists of supported
        units, you can just start typing and the list is automatically
        filtered. <strong>(Windows, Linux)</strong></li>
        <li><a
        href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unit-converter-convert-units/id1590954132">Unit
        Converter</a> looks super generic (even the name sounds
        generic), but it has the units I need as an engineer that other
        apps don’t. The interface is as spartan as you can get, but it
        really is quite powerful. Be sure to read the help because there
        is some hidden (or at least non-obvious) functionality like
        “favorites”, simple math evaluation, and time conversion.

        <p><em>Note that this section is dedicated to standalone
        graphing/plotting software, but apps in other categories
        (e.g. statistics, CAS, and office suites) have graphing/plotting
        capabilities as well. Also worth noting, Python libraries like
        Matplotlib and Seaborn (see <a
        href="#programming">Programming</a>) make standalone graphing
        software somewhat redundant for me, but the feature sets and
        easier-to-use interfaces make these apps below still the best
        tool for some jobs.</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/">gnuplot</a>: While
        it has a steeper learning curve than a typical GUI driven
        program, gnuplot’s spartan interface helps you plot and tweak
        quickly without having to know the commands. This venerable GNU
        program has been around since the 1980s quietly excelling in its
        domain. If something can be plotted at all, it can probably be
        plotted by gnuplot. You might want to start with the demo
        gallery to see what it can do.</li>
        <li><a href="https://veusz.github.io/">Veusz</a> is a great
        plotting package that has a robust graphical interface and an
        impressive array of supported plot types. From 2D to 3D, from
        box plots to polar plots, Veusz has you covered. The main
        selling point for me is that you have total control of
        everything you see on the graph: colors, lines, fonts, you name
        it. You should be able to get exactly what you want. There are
        some downsides, most notably: strange handling of error bars,
        lackluster data manipulation, and the histogram functionality
        could be more robust.</li>
        <li><a href="https://labplot.kde.org/">LabPlot</a> is fantastic
        software for XY plots, although it does excellent histograms as
        well. It is incredibly customizable, but be aware it takes some
        exploration to really figure out everything it can do (which is
        a LOT). You can make some incredible looking plots that would
        look at home in even the prettiest info-graphics. There are plot
        “themes” which make it easy to quickly try out some different
        looks. Labplot will definitely produce something that doesn’t
        look like just another Excel plot. Other notable features
        include impressive data manipulation, interactive plots, XY plot
        digitizer, as well as robust curve fitting.</li>

        Digitizer</a> is a lifesaver when you need to extract X-Y data
        from a raster format image or a printed graph from a book or
        pdf. Instead of breaking out the ruler, just click on some
        points and Engauge will scale, transform, and orient the plot
        for you, exporting the XY data to a CSV file.

        replace commercial software like Mathematica, Maple, and Matlab,
        and it has advanced enough that it really does make those
        packages unnecessary for many use cases. Sage brings some of the
        best tools in the open-source world together under one interface
        to create an incredibly powerful package that’s useful to nearly
        every STEM field. The main problem with Sage is the complete
        absence of a user interface. The novice is presented with an
        empty prompt, and is expected to know what to type. It could
        really benefit from a cohesive graphical interface that guides
        the user a little better (like wxMaxima or the commercial
        options).</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://maxima.sourceforge.io/download.html">Maxima</a>:
        Symbolic computer algebra system with robust plotting. Be sure
        to use the bundled app called wxMaxima, which is an easy-to-use
        graphical interface that wraps the Maxima backend. Given that
        SageMath has Maxima built in, this standalone version may seem
        redundant, but novices will find wxMaxima easier to jump into
        and start using right away.
        <ul>
        <li>An alternative to a standalone app like Maxima for simple
        symbolic algebra is <a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a>,
        which technically isn’t an application, but rather a Python
        library. If you use Sympy in a Jupyter notebook inside VS Code,
        you have a pretty incredible environment for CAS. This is
        actually my preferred solution, but you need to be fluent in
        Python for this to be viable.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">GNU
        Octave</a>: A numerical computation program that started off as
        a MATLAB clone, so porting programs is fairly trivial. The use
        cases of a program like this (for me) are pretty narrow these
        days given the accessibility and capabilities of programming
        languages like Julia and Python (along with libraries like Scipy
        and Numpy), and the advancement of more broad-purpose software
        like SageMath. Octave is still immensely powerful though, and a
        great environment for mathematical exploration, so I’m leaving
        it on my list. Also note that SageMath has an Octave interface,
        so if you have it in your path, you can call Octave functions
        directly from Sage.
        <ul>
        <li>The obvious runner-up here for numerical computation is <a
        href="https://www.scilab.org/">Scilab</a>, which has a long
        history as a capable numerical analysis package and has always
        had significant overlap in functionality with Octave (and MATLAB
        for that matter). You may like Scilab better for some reason, so
        if you’re serious about math you should check it out, but the
        Octave community is more active and there are more libraries
        available for Octave, so I’d still start there.</li>

        is an interactive notebook where you can embed code and plots
        and easily share the sessions with others or save them for
        later. This is a front end for scientific computing languages
        like Python, R, and Julia that is perfect for interactive
        exploration. I could have easily listed this under the
        Programming category, but Jupyter is really more of a scientific
        computing platform than a programming environment. This is where
        you do math or data science, explore statistics, and slice,
        dice, and manipulate data before analysis and visualization.
        <ul>
        <li>If you are a Julia programmer, we can’t talk about
        interactive environments without mentioning <a
        href="https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl">Pluto</a>. It’s a

        great package for quickly analyzing some data and making
        decent-looking stats plots with very little effort. If I want
        simple descriptive statistics, a histogram, or a quick t-test,
        Jamovi makes it easy (although honestly, if I need much more
        than that I’m probably in Jupyter using Python with libraries
        like Pandas to help slice and dice the data.) Jamovi looks very
        polished, and the core functionality is there, but I wish there
        were more customization options for the graphs and more data
        manipulation tools. Also, it’s worth noting that Jamovi is one
        of the many front-ends for R, the 800-pound-gorilla of stats
        packages, so there are a number of modules available to add
        functionality. Jamovi is under very active development, and new
        releases come out at least monthly, so I’m excited to see what’s
        coming in the future.
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://jasp-stats.org/">JASP</a> looks very
        similar to Jamovi, and in fact, at first glance the interfaces
        appear to be near clones. While I find Jamovi just plain better
        in a number of ways, I’m keeping my eye on JASP because it
        appears to be under active development as well, and JASP
        supports some analyses that Jamovi doesn’t while still offering
        an easy-to-use interface.</li>
        <li>On paper, <a
        href="https://www.blueskystatistics.com/">BlueSky Statistics</a>
        should be the easy winner in this category. It has many, many
        more features than Jamovi. However, I don’t find the interface
        as intuitive for casual analysis, and by default the plots look
        fairly bad. The plots can certainly be tweaked through the R
        language, but it isn’t transparent to the casual user. Besides
        the impressive collection of analysis methods, the real reason I
        might reach for BlueSky instead of Jamovi is the robust set of
        data manipulation tools.</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/resources/past/">PAST</a>
        is the only app in this category that isn’t just a front-end for
        R. If you look past the deceptively plain interface, this is a
        super powerful stats program chock-full of functionality.
        There’s no safety net or hand-holding to help you interpret the
        results, but it has an amazing manual describing the equations
        used and even includes extensive citations, so this is no black
        box. It has a very robust set of statistical plotting tools, and
        the histograms are actually pretty good with a fair amount of
        customization (including overlaying a normal distribution).</li>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/">Miller</a> is
        an incredible tool for working with CSV files (and others) from
        the command line. You reshape, filter, and even create new
        columns based on operations performed on other columns. If you
        work with CSV files, especially large files or large numbers of

        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.freecad.org//">FreeCAD</a> is the best
        open source solution for making parametric 3D models and
        generating professional-looking drawings/prints, even if it
        makes it harder than it should be. Its capabilities are pretty
        incredible for what it is (especially after coming out of beta
        and releasing v1.0), but if I’m being honest, it still falls
        short of any of the top-tier commercial products. The interface
        can be clunky and often works against me, and for some tasks I
        just can’t figure out an efficient workflow. Having said that,
        there is a lot of great functionality here, including a good
        constraint manager, impressive assembly capabilities, and a
        decent CAM module that generates usable G-code. At the end of

        Fusion 360</a>: I hate to rely on proprietary software that
        might be pulled behind a paywall tomorrow, but Fusion 360 is a
        professional-grade 3D modeler that can’t be passed up when
        they’re giving it away for free. Professionally, I’ve used
        everything from Pro/E to Catia to I-DEAS to NX to Inventor and a
        half dozen more CAD packages, and Fusion 360 is as good as any
        of them for creating 3D models. The interface is incredibly
        intuitive if you’ve used any real CAD package before. I use
        Fusion on both Windows and Mac and switching between platforms
        is seamless. If you sign up as a hobbyist (i.e. not for
        commercial use) you can get a free license. They recently
        further crippled the free hobbyist version (e.g. file format
        support and number of active documents allowed), but it’s still
        very usable for personal projects.</li>

        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://solvespace.com/index.pl">Solvespace</a> is
        such a tiny, fast, quirky, unique, and capable program, I had to
        mention it. Don’t let the retro look fool you. This is a
        powerful 2D/3D parametric modeler with a legit constraint
        solver. Besides FreeCAD, that is a very rare find in free CAD
        software. This interface is nothing like a standard CAD package,
        but if you are into making 3D objects for 3D printing, this
        program is an interesting option. For normal use, I think the
        glaring omission in its feature set is a tool for adding
        fillets/rounds. That’s a deal breaker for me.</li>

        looking for an electronics design program, you’re probably
        looking for KiCad. I t can do everything from creating a
        schematic to designing a PCB. The learning curve is a bit more
        than I would like for doing simple schematics, but it’s worth
        learning.
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.tinycad.net/">TinyCAD</a> is a good
        alternative to KiCad if you do circuit design. I don’t know that
        it can do anything that KiCad can’t, but I think it is easier to
        use in some ways and I find it better for some jobs. Its chief
        short-coming is that it’s Windows-only.

        This is a really simple program for making quick schematics.
        It’s like the Notepad.exe or Windows Paint of the schematics
        world. Not very glamorous or loaded with features, but it works
        in a pinch. (By the way, when you click on the ExpressSCH link,
        you’ll want to download ExpressPCB Classic and you’ll get
        ExpressSCH too.) <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>

        <li><a
        href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/">Ultimaker
        Cura</a>: Cura is a great slicer that works with any printer
        (not just Ultimaker’s). I think it’s the most user-friendly
        slicer out there, especially for those new to 3D printing. It
        has plenty of features without overwhelming the user, but most
        importantly, the defaults are all good enough to slice your
        first model without fiddling with parameters or knowing too
        much.
        <ul>
        <li>The other leading general-purpose slicers out there are <a

        (which is a fork of Bamboo Studio, which is a fork of
        PrusaSlicer as well). I would say that all three are more
        powerful than Cura, but with added complexity and harder to
        setup out of the box, but all are a solid choice with certain
        advantages over the others. I would probably go with Orca if I
        were to choose a slicer that isn’t Cura.</li>

        OpenStreetMap data), this is probably your best bet. It is
        shocking how many terrible GPX editors are out there, and JOSM
        stands out as a truly capable package in comparison, even if it
        can be unintuitive at times. If you need to edit a GPS track to
        clean it up before uploading to a website or archiving, JOSM is
        your best bet.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a> is where you go
        when you want to work with GIS data to make custom maps, combine
        map data from various sources, etc. There is overlap between
        QGIS and JOSM for sure, but they really do different things, so
        it’s worth having both in your toolbox if you are into maps. My
        favorite function in QGIS is the Georeferencer tool which lets
        you map a raster image map onto actual coordinates. This is
        handy for doing things like superimposing a scanned trail map
        onto a topo map. Speaking of which, QGIS also supports GeoPDF

        is the search tool you need if you want to search file contents.
        You choose the folders you want to index, and a low-resource
        process watches for changes in real time. Searching for
        filenames or contents works just as expected. The functionality
        is great even if the interface looks very dated.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.voidtools.com/">Everything</a>: If you
        just want to search filenames, Everything is your best bet. It
        supports wildcards, boolean operations, exact cases/phrases, and
        regular expressions. Just type a filename, and you’ll get
        immediate results from all your drives instantly. If you want to
        search network drives, you will need to go to Options and add
        them to your search folders under Indexing. You can also search
        file contents, although that will take much longer because it
        doesn’t support (or require) indexing.

        Windows. <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.keka.io/en/">Keka</a> is easy to
        recommend because it does more than Mac’s built-in Archive
        Utility by supporting more formats and adding compression with
        encryption. It’s free from the website, or a paid app on the
        AppStore. <strong>(Mac)</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>If you don’t need fancy compression options, and you just
        want something that will automatically decompress just about
        every format you’ve probably ever heard of, you may prefer <a
        href="https://theunarchiver.com/">The Unarchiver</a>. The
        interface is non-existent. You just click on an archive in

        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="https://peazip.github.io/">PeaZip</a> is worth a
        look if 7-zip doesn’t work for you because you’ve encountered
        some really obscure format, or if you’re on Mac or Linux. It
        supports basically every format that you would conceivably (or
        inconceivably) run into. The interface doesn’t look native
        (especially on Mac), but it is very usable and great for

        Imaging/Formatting/Repair</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">balena Etcher</a>: A
        nice clean, easy-to-use program to write disk images to flash
        devices (USB drives, microSD cards, etc.). This is great for
        putting Linux distros on bootable USB drives or setting up a
        microSD card for a Raspberry Pi.
        <ul>
        <li>Runner up goes to <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a>. It
        gives you more options than Etcher at the cost of some added
        complexity. I have also run across some images where Rufus works
        where Etcher fails, so it’s handy to have Rufus around even if I
        use Etcher most of the time. <strong>(Windows)</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.ventoy.net/">Ventoy</a> serves the same
        purpose as a traditional disk imager, although it adds more
        flexibility and functions quite differently. You install Ventoy
        onto a USB drive via the handy Windows installer, and then you
        can drop as many bootable disk images (ISO, IMG, etc.) as you
        like onto the drive. When you boot to the USB drive, Ventoy will
        give you a menu to let you choose which image to boot. Super
        handy way of carrying several OSes in your pocket, all on a
        single drive. <strong>(Windows, Linux)</strong></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree">Macrium
        Reflect Free</a>: Great for making disk images or transitioning

        Partition Master</a>: The Windows 10 disk management tools are
        limited in functionality, and sooner or later you may need a
        tool like this to fix/partition/format a drive. My most common
        use case is recovering all the space on a USB drive that has a
        Linux image on it, perhaps with multiple partitions, one of
        which is the EFI boot partition. The Windows Disk Management
        tools might let you delete some (but not all) partitions, while
        the free version of Partition Master will have you back in
        business in seconds. It also resizes partitions and clones
        disks, but the free version won’t create an image of a live OS

        need is to fix an SD card. Some devices can be finicky about the
        format of SD/microSD cards, and this official application from
        the SD Association has fixed some obscure issues I’ve had in the
        past. This is especially true of SDHC/SDXC cards since Windows
        10 seems to like formatting higher capacity cards as NTFS

        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/">Google
        Drive for Desktop</a>: For real-time cloud backup and
        synchronization, this is an easy solution if you just want an
        off-site copy of your data that is accesible everywhere,
        including mobile devices.</li>
        <li><a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>: If you don’t
        trust someone else with your data or you want more control of
        your data, you can host your own cloud with Syncthing . If it’s
        confusing why this is different than something like
        FreeFileSync, Syncthing shines at realtime continuous
        synchronization while FreeFileSync is geared towards a file
        backup that runs (for instance) once a day. The big bonus is
        Syncthing’s Android app, allowing you to sync files between your
        computer and your phone, but the lack of an iOS app is a serious
        problem for me.</li>

        Package Management/Software Installer</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/">winget</a>:
        If you wish you had Linux-like package management on Windows
        (e.g. apt, yum, or pacman), winget has you covered. Microsoft’s
        new package manager isn’t exactly well-advertised, but it works
        well and the list of supported packages is growing. On a recent
        Windows build, you probably already have it installed. The best
        feature is that it works with existing programs whether they
        were installed with winget or not. It integrates with the
        Windows “Apps and Features” interface in Settings (or the older
        “Programs and Features” in Control Panel) so it knows what you
        have installed. It isn’t perfect though. Sometimes it can be
        frustrating working with packages with the same or similar
        names, or multiple versions of the same package. There’s room
        for improvement, but I still think it works better than
        Chocolatey (see below).</li>
        <li><a href="https://scoop.sh/">Scoop</a> is a command line
        package manager focusing on non-GUI tools to make Linux users
        feel at home on Windows. For instance, need to quickly install
        nmap or curl? Scoop is a great way to do that. There is also an
        “extra” bucket (i.e. repo) of tools that includes GUI apps and
        other tools that don’t fit into the main inclusion criteria for
        scoop. The real selling point here is that it installs
        everything in your home directory (or other specified location),
        so you don’t need admin privileges and you won’t see UAC prompts
        every time you add or remove a program. Scoop may look redundant
        to winget, but it works differently enough that it is the better
        choice for certain situations. For me, Scoop is essential if
        you’re stuck on a company computer without admin rights.</li>

        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://patchmypc.com/home-updater">Patch My PC</a>
        is pretty cool. If you don’t want an overbearing package
        manager, but you do want up to date programs, this is a good
        option. It scans your installed programs, shows you which ones
        have available updates, and then it helps update them. It
        supports a decent selection of popular software, although it
        isn’t going to cover every app on your computer. This is great
        for casual users.</li>
        <li>Not long ago <a
        href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> was probably the
        most well-known solution to package management on Windows. It
        may still be a better choice for some people as it has broad
        package support. It supports thousands of packages, and the vast
        majority of the software listed on Blake’s Essentials can be
        found there. Having said that, I wish it were more robust. I’ve
        had plenty of headaches where Chocolatey wouldn’t let me
        uninstall software or I had weird conflicts from multiple
        versions of packages that I couldn’t remedy. I switched to
        winget largely because of these issues.</li>
        <li>I’m guessing the most popular graphical package manager out
        there is <a href="https://ninite.com/">Ninite</a> . It’s great
        software, it’s easy to use, but it just doesn’t include enough
        packages to really be a full-fledged package manager. If Ninite
        supports all the packages you want, you might want to try it
        first. Personally, I see Ninite as something I can use on my
        parents’ computer to keep their software up to date.</li>

        Homebrew gets you going with minimal hassle. There is plenty of
        debate on whether its approach is technically sound, but it
        works for me. For instance, if I want to install git, I just
        type: <code>brew install git</code>
        <ul>
        <li>The other popular option out there is <a

        downloaded from the Mac App Store and apps that use Sparkle for

        a lot of options out there in this category, but I like
        Bleachbit because it’s completely free and open-source, so at
        least you know what it’s trying to do under the hood. Be aware
        that mucking about in the registry isn’t really necessary on
        modern Windows, but Bleachbit can do way more than registry
        pruning, and it’s worth looking at all of its functionality

        care of all the hassle and the out-of-the-box experience
        includes smart command completion, customized prompts with git

        make this a real powerhouse of productivity once you learn the
        tool.</li>
        <li><a href="https://maccy.app/">Maccy</a> is my preferred
        clipboard manager for Mac. CopyQ does work fine on Mac, but
        Maccy just does it better and cleaner for my usual use cases. If
        you don’t need CopyQ’s advanced scripting, Maccy gets the job
        done while integrating seamlessly into the Mac desktop.

        great free solution for running virtual machines. It is an easy
        and robust way of running Linux (and other OSes) under Windows
        or Mac, which is often handy for some toolchains or just testing
        out a script or something in a Linux environment.
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.qemu.org">QEMU</a> is also an option
        worth considering as it can be significantly faster than
        Virtualbox in some situations, and it can emulate systems that
        Virtualbox can’t. For simple use cases, I would still start with
        Virtualbox though.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><a href="https://mac.getutm.app">UTM</a> is my first choice
        for virtual machines on Mac, including Apple Silicon Macs. It’s
        just easy to use and does what I need it to do. It’s great for
        creating Linux sandboxes where I don’t have to worry about
        messing up my Mac when I’m building out certain toolchains.

        because they are so good. (And they are still being updated!)
        You can download the whole suite, or individual tools. I’m going
        to highlight just a couple here to give you the flavor of the

        PowerToys</a>: Old-timers will remember this suite for decades
        ago, but it’s back and better than ever (and open sourced!).
        This collection of Windows enhancements include adding Markdown
        and SVG support to the Windows Explorer preview pane, windows
        snapping, PowerRename, a color picker, easy image resizing, a
        keyboard manager that lets you remap keys, plus lots more.
        (Quick tip: use this to remap your CapsLock key to act like a

        configured in any number of ways, but I have it setup so when I
        press caps-lock, it is the same as pressing shift-command-ctrl.
        Then I map that combo to whatever I like in my various apps.
        e.g. in VS Code, pressing caps-lock and P will run the current

        is one of those apps I didn’t know I needed. I wouldn’t have
        looked for it, but after stumbling across it and trying it out,
        it’s amazing. If you have an external monitor, you need this so
        you can control the brightness through your keyboard. It also
        normalizes brightness between the build-in screen and an

        feature set including dark mode, and it supports v3, v4, v5, v7,
        and v8. To top it all off, it comes with a nice suite of stories
        to get you started. (Mac <a

        This is my current choice for a multi-format interpreter that
        handles more than just Z machine files, and while it’s the new
        kid on the block, it has novel features like autosave. It looks
        really nice to me (great fonts and themes), but it uses ZVM as
        the Z interpreter, so it only supports Z3, Z4, Z5, &amp; Z8.
        Other format support includes Glulx, Hugo, TADS, and Ink. This
        seems to be under active development, so we’ll see where it
        goes.
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/">Gargoyle</a> deserves
        a mention because it supports every format I’ve ever run across
        because it is basically just a wrapper for a number of
        interpreters. The default (and excellent) <a
        href="https://cspiegel.github.io/bocfel/">Bocfel</a> Z machine
        interpreter has partial support for z6 files too. Its other
        claim to fame is its focus on good typesetting, which is a
        really interesting niche. But be warned, it essentially has no
        user interface, so you need to edit a text file to change fonts
        and whatnot.</li>
        <li><a

        This is easier to use than Gargoyle for sure, so I’m mentioning
        it here, but it has minimal customization options. You might
        want to choose this if you need Glulx support and want an
        interface similar to Windows Frotz. It’s probably not the best
        choice for Z-Machine files because it only supports versions 3,
        4, 5, and 8 story files. The project has been stagnant since
        2013, so what you see is what you get.

        IF games, you know mapping is essential, and Trizbort helps you
        do that. There is even an automap function that works pretty
        well. <strong>(Windows)</strong>

        <li>A good cross-platform alternative is <a
        href="https://trizbort.io/">Trizbort.io</a> which is a webapp
        version of Trizbort with most of the same functionality. Works
        great in any browser. This is what I use on Mac and Linux.</li>
