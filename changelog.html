        <h1 id="change-log">Change Log</h1>
        <h2 id="section">2024-09-12</h2>
        <p>Added honorable mentions to <strong>MacTeX</strong> and
        <strong>Tectonic</strong>.</p>
        <p>Moved up <strong>Openshot</strong> as my preferred video
        editor over <strong>Shotcut</strong>, which I haven’t been using
        for a while due to several limitations.</p>
        <p>Dropped <strong>FontBase</strong> from my list because basic
        features are now subscription-only.</p>
        <h2 id="section-1">2024-07-24</h2>
        <p>Moved this whole site to Github. It’s written in Markdown and
        then procesed with pandoc. Source is <a
        href="http://github.com/blakegarretson/essentials">here</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="section-2">2024-07-23</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Angry IP Scanner</strong>, which has become my
        go-to port scanner on all platforms.</p>
        <p>Moved <strong>KiCad</strong> up to my primary
        schematic/circuit design program. I have been reaching for it
        first for a while.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Amphetamine</strong>. Not sure how I took so
        long to add this one.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Tot</strong>.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Boop</strong>. I’m starting to use it more.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Warp</strong> terminal.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Zed</strong>. It’s actually usable now.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>RawTherapee</strong> as an alternative to
        darktable.</p>
        <h2 id="section-3">2023-08-28</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Jellyfin</strong> after using it along side
        Plex for some time now.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>PDFgear</strong> as it quickly moved to my tool
        of choice.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Electorrent</strong>. It’s pretty.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Maccy</strong> as I found myself using it
        exclusively whenever I’m on Mac.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>System Color Picker</strong>. Handy.</p>
        <h2 id="section-4">2023-08-15</h2>
        <p>After testing out new software for a while, I’m making a
        bunch of edits:</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Transnomino</strong> for a Mac file renamer
        after using it for a while.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Hyperkey</strong> for Mac. I found myself using
        it everyday.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> browser and removed
        <strong>Brave</strong>.</p>
        <p>Added an AI generation section with <strong>Draw
        Things</strong>, <strong>Diffusion Bee</strong>, and
        <strong>ComfyUI</strong>.</p>
        <p>Added notes about <strong>VS Code Insiders</strong> and web
        edition.</p>
        <p><strong>Vectornator</strong> is renamed
        <strong>Curve</strong>.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Friendly Streaming</strong>.</p>
        <h2 id="section-5">2022-12-10</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Latest</strong>. I’ve been using it on Mac, and
        it is pretty convenient.</p>
        <h2 id="section-6">2022-11-09</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>OmniDriveSweeper</strong>.</p>
        <h2 id="section-7">2022-11-01</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Kodi</strong> and <strong>PDFsam
        Basic</strong>.</p>
        <h2 id="section-8">2022-10-25</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>MonitorControl</strong>,
        <strong>FBReader</strong>, and <strong>FontBase</strong>.</p>
        <h2 id="section-9">2022-10-16</h2>
        <p><strong>Keka</strong> is a great compression tool for Mac,
        and I find myself reaching for it more, so I’m adding it
        here.</p>
        <h2 id="section-10">2022-10-13</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>MusicBrainz Picard</strong>. I needed to clean
        up a bunch of mp3s on my Mac, and this did the job way better
        than the alternatives.</p>
        <h2 id="section-11">2022-10-08</h2>
        <p>I’m recommending <strong>Ardour</strong> for Linux users
        now.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>LimeChat</strong> for a Mac IRC client.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Permanent Eraser</strong> for Mac.</p>
        <h2 id="section-12">2022-09-21</h2>
        <p>Finally decided to just make this a list for Windows, Mac,
        and Linux software as opposed to just Windows. It turns out
        about 80% (or more?) of my apps were cross-platform anyway, so
        it isn’t much harder to throw in my favorite Mac and Linux apps
        too.</p>
        <h2 id="section-13">2022-09-18</h2>
        <p><strong>Simplenote</strong> is now my preferred text-based
        note-taking app, edging out Obsidian, which is still a worthy
        runner=up.</p>
        <h2 id="section-14">2022-03-06</h2>
        <p>I added <strong>WinMerge</strong> back on as an alternative
        to Meld. I still like Meld better overall, but WinMerge shines
        in some tasks.</p>
        <h2 id="section-15">2022-03-01</h2>
        <p>I added <strong>TinyCAD</strong> after using it enough to
        find it useful in certain circumstances.</p>
        <h2 id="section-16">2022-02-22</h2>
        <p>I’ve used <strong>LibreCAD</strong> for a couple projects and
        it’s earned a spot on my list. It’s definitely useful for a
        certain domain of projects.</p>
        <h2 id="section-17">2022-02-14</h2>
        <p><strong>DocFetcher</strong> is now my local file search
        solution of choice. The file content indexing pushes it ahead of
        Everything, and FileSeek got kicked to the reject pile.</p>
        <p>Created a CSV category under the STEM section, and added
        Miller and Tad to it. Both are super handy.</p>
        <h2 id="section-18">2022-01-29</h2>
        <p>Finally added <strong>winget</strong>,
        <strong>scoop</strong>, and <strong>Patch My PC</strong>, which
        I’ve been using for a while now to great success. Sorry
        Chocolatey!</p>
        <p>Also added <strong>Git Extensions</strong>.</p>
        <h2 id="section-19">2021-12-20</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Tabby</strong> as a second option under
        <strong>Windows Terminal</strong>. It’s a great app.</p>
        <p>Expanded the recommendation for
        <strong>Transmission</strong>.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>OBS Studio</strong>.</p>
        <h2 id="section-20">2021-10-01</h2>
        <p><strong>Windows Terminal</strong> dethroned
        <strong>ConEmu</strong> for my choice of terminal software. I
        just like it better now. It’s simple but still has a robust
        feature set.</p>
        <h2 id="section-21">2021-09-18</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Chrome Remote Desktop</strong> for a remote
        access solution. Its really simple and requires none of the
        configuration headaches that come along with VNC.</p>
        <h2 id="section-22">2021-09-17</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Obsidian</strong> under note-taking. I’ve been
        trying it out for a while, and it definitely does a lot
        right.</p>
        <h2 id="section-23">2021-07-11</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Waveform Free</strong> as an option for a DAW,
        and mentioned <strong>Ardour</strong> while I was at it.</p>
        <h2 id="section-24">2021-07-05</h2>
        <p>I switched my VNC pick back to <strong>UltraVNC</strong>. I
        had dabbled with TigerVNC for a while because it felt a little
        more lightweight, but UltraVNC is just better for my use
        cases.</p>
        <h2 id="section-25">2021-06-29</h2>
        <p>Added a mention of <strong>Pluto</strong> alongside
        Jupyter.</p>
        <p>Updated ConEmu website link.</p>
        <h2 id="section-26">2021-06-15</h2>
        <p>Migrated site from Wordpress to a simpler system. Now I’m
        just using pandoc to process Markdown files to HTML, and I’m
        just hand tweaking some CSS and HTML templates.</p>
        <h2 id="section-27">2021-04-21</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Ventoy</strong>. It’s a handy tool that was not
        on my radar until recently.</p>
        <p>Also added a note to the <strong>ShareX</strong> entry that
        it can do screen capture. I’ve been using that feature and it’s
        worth the download just for that alone.</p>
        <h2 id="section-28">2021-03-11</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Microsoft Powertoys</strong> and the
        <strong>Sysinternals</strong> utilities suites. I have used both
        of these for probably close to two decades, and they are super
        handy. I’m surprised I haven’t added them sooner.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>micro</strong> in the text editor section.
        That’s a really cool up-and-comer in the text editor field.
        People just aren’t learning vi and emacs anymore (or not like
        they used to anyway), so I could see micro becoming the de facto
        standard editor on Linux someday. A newbie could open it an do
        useful things. It will likely eclipse nano quickly.</p>
        <h2 id="section-29">2021-02-28</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>CopyQ</strong>. I’ve been trying some clipboard
        managers, most notably <strong>Ditto</strong> and CopyQ. I had
        several bugs and issues with Ditto, and CopyQ worked out of the
        box, so it gets the win.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>Ninite</strong> as an alternative to
        Chocolatey. I’ve used Ninite for years longer than Chocolatey,
        and I still use it for niche cases, so it deserves a
        mention.</p>
        <p>Added <strong>ProduKey</strong>. I’ve used it a number of
        times over the years and it’s a lifesaver.  </p>
        <h2 id="section-30">2021-02-20</h2>
        <p>Added <strong>Mp3tag</strong>. It used to be on the list, but
        through disuse, I dropped it. After needing it again for a big
        music reorganization project, I figured I’d put it back on the
        list. It’s useful.</p>
        <h2 id="section-31">2021-02-10</h2>
        <p>Initial version of the website at <a
        href="https://www.blakesessentials.com"
        class="uri">https://www.blakesessentials.com</a>. I maintained
        my Essentials list over at my personal website for over 15
        years, and I decided to move it to its own domain and convert it
        to WordPress mostly just for fun.</p>
