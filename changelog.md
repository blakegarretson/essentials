Added **Tabby** as a second option under **Windows Terminal**. It's a great app.

Expanded the recommendation for **Transmission**.

Added **OBS Studio**.

## 2021-10-01

**Windows Terminal** dethroned **ConEmu** for my choice of terminal software. I just like it better now. It's simple but still has a robust feature set.

## 2021-09-18

Added **Chrome Remote Desktop** for a remote access solution. Its really simple and requires none of the configuration headaches that come along with VNC.

## 2021-09-17

Added **Obsidian** under note-taking. I've been trying it out for a while, and it definitely does a lot right.

## 2021-07-11

Added **Waveform Free** as an option for a DAW, and mentioned **Ardour** while I was at it.

## 2021-07-05

I switched my VNC pick back to **UltraVNC**. I had dabbled with TigerVNC for a while because it felt a little more lightweight, but UltraVNC is just better for my use cases.

## 2021-06-29

Added a mention of **Pluto** alongside Jupyter.

Updated ConEmu website link.

## 2021-06-15

Migrated site from Wordpress to a simpler system. Now I'm just using pandoc to process Markdown files to HTML, and I'm just hand tweaking some CSS and HTML templates.

## 2021-04-21

Added **Ventoy**. It's a handy tool that was not on my radar until
recently.

Also added a note to the **ShareX** entry that it can do screen capture.
I've been using that feature and it's worth the download just for that
alone.

## 2021-03-11

Added **Microsoft Powertoys** and the **Sysinternals** utilities suites.
I have used both of these for probably close to two decades, and they
are super handy. I'm surprised I haven't added them sooner.

Added **micro** in the text editor section. That's a really cool
up-and-comer in the text editor field. People just aren't learning vi
and emacs anymore (or not like they used to anyway), so I could see
micro becoming the de facto standard editor on Linux someday. A newbie
could open it an do useful things. It will likely eclipse nano quickly.

## 2021-02-28

Added **CopyQ**. I've been trying some clipboard managers, most notably
**Ditto** and CopyQ. I had several bugs and issues with Ditto, and CopyQ
worked out of the box, so it gets the win.

Added **Ninite** as an alternative to Chocolatey. I've used Ninite for
years longer than Chocolatey, and I still use it for niche cases, so it
deserves a mention.

Added **ProduKey**. I've used it a number of times over the years and
it's a lifesaver.  

## 2021-02-20

Added **Mp3tag**. It used to be on the list, but through disuse, I
dropped it. After needing it again for a big music reorganization
project, I figured I'd put it back on the list. It's useful.

## 2021-02-10

Initial version of the website at <https://www.blakesessentials.com>. I
maintained my Essentials list over at my personal website for over 15
years, and I decided to move it to its own domain and convert it to
WordPress mostly just for fun.
