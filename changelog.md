# Change Log

## 2025-10-05

Added **Readest** and demoted **FBReader** to a second choice. Readest is a modern take on the ebook reader while FBReader is starting to feel dated.

Removed **Sumatra PDF**. I just don't use it anymore. 

## 2025-09-20

Added **NetNewsWire**. I think it's nearly as good as the paid app **News Explorer**. 

## 2025-09-15

Added **Leader Key**. I really like the approach it takes and I’m using it more often than the alternatives.

I’m recommending **JASP** over **Jamovi** now.

Added **Loop** and demoted to **Rectangle** to an alternative. 

## 2025-06-18

Added **Itsycal**. I’ve been enjoying far more than the stock calendar widgets.

## 2025-06-03

Removed **Paint.NET**. The infamous default Windows **Paint** program has been updated in Windows 11 and is adequate for simple edits, and for anything more complicated you probably want Gimp, Krita, Photoscape X, etc.  Paint.NET just doesn’t bring much to the party anymore. Also, the website has become a mess of ads and it’s hard to even download without clicking on the wrong thing.

## 2025-05-06

Added **JustChords**.

Added the **BONUS (Non-free)** section. This is just for convenience for me so when I set up a new computer I have a list of apps to install. I won’t list them all here, but I added a bunch dozen or so paid apps that I like.

## 2025-05-04

Removed **Frotz8** and **Filfre**. Neither has been updated since 2013 (coincidentally), and they are pretty stale at this point.

## 2025-04-30

Added **ChatGTP** and **Jan** as the offline alternative.

Added **Kap**.

Added **Ice** menu bar manager for Mac.

Added **Stacher7**.

Added **qView**.

## 2025-01-03

Added **QEMU** and **UTM**. I’ve been using them for a while now and probably should have added them sooner.

Added **UniGetUI**.

Added **Bulk Rename Utility**.

## 2025-01-01

Rewrote and updated a lot of entries.

Removed **Curve** (Linearity) because the free version is pretty limited now.

Added snippets managers **SnippetsLab** and **massCode**.

Added **Zettlr**, **MarkEdit**, and **MarkText**, and rearranged the note-taking and writing apps. There is a lot of overlap here.

Added **Keyboard Cowboy**.

Added **TinkerTool**.

Added **LosslessCut**.

Added **LanguageTool**.

Added **Pearcleaner**.

Added **Orca Slicer**.

## 2024-09-12

Added honorable mentions to **MacTeX** and **Tectonic**. 

Moved up **Openshot** as my preferred video editor over **Shotcut**, which I haven't been using for a while due to several limitations. 

Dropped **FontBase** from my list because basic features are now subscription-only.

## 2024-07-24

Moved this whole site to Github. It's written in Markdown and then procesed with pandoc. Source is [here](http://github.com/blakegarretson/essentials).

## 2024-07-23

Added **Angry IP Scanner**, which has become my go-to port scanner on all platforms.

Moved **KiCad** up to my primary schematic/circuit design program. I have been reaching for it first for a while.

Added **Amphetamine**. Not sure how I took so long to add this one.

Added **Tot**. 

Added **Boop**. I'm starting to use it more.

Added **Warp** terminal.

Added **Zed**. It's actually usable now.

Added **RawTherapee** as an alternative to darktable.

## 2023-08-28

Added **Jellyfin** after using it along side Plex for some time now.

Added **PDFgear** as it quickly moved to my tool of choice.

Added **Electorrent**. It's pretty.

Added **Maccy** as I found myself using it exclusively whenever I'm on Mac.

Added **System Color Picker**. Handy.

## 2023-08-15

After testing out new software for a while, I'm making a bunch of edits:

Added **Transnomino** for a Mac file renamer after using it for a while.

Added **Hyperkey** for Mac. I found myself using it everyday.

Added **DuckDuckGo** browser and removed **Brave**.

Added an AI generation section with **Draw Things**, **Diffusion Bee**, and **ComfyUI**.

Added notes about **VS Code Insiders** and web edition.

**Vectornator** is renamed **Curve**.

Added **Friendly Streaming**.

## 2022-12-10

Added **Latest**. I've been using it on Mac, and it is pretty convenient.

## 2022-11-09

Added **OmniDriveSweeper**.

## 2022-11-01

Added **Kodi** and **PDFsam Basic**.

## 2022-10-25

Added **MonitorControl**, **FBReader**, and **FontBase**.

## 2022-10-16

**Keka** is a great compression tool for Mac, and I find myself reaching for it more, so I'm adding it here.

## 2022-10-13

Added **MusicBrainz Picard**. I needed to clean up a bunch of mp3s on my Mac, and this did the job way better than the alternatives.

## 2022-10-08

I'm recommending **Ardour** for Linux users now.

Added **LimeChat** for a Mac IRC client.

Added **Permanent Eraser** for Mac.

## 2022-09-21

Finally decided to just make this a list for Windows, Mac, and Linux software as opposed to just Windows. It turns out about 80% (or more?) of my apps were cross-platform anyway, so it isn't much harder to throw in my favorite Mac and Linux apps too.

## 2022-09-18

**Simplenote** is now my preferred text-based note-taking app, edging out Obsidian, which is still a worthy runner=up.

## 2022-03-06

I added **WinMerge** back on as an alternative to Meld. I still like Meld better overall, but WinMerge shines in some tasks.

## 2022-03-01

I added **TinyCAD** after using it enough to find it useful in certain circumstances.

## 2022-02-22

I've used **LibreCAD** for a couple projects and it's earned a spot on my list. It's definitely useful for a certain domain of projects.

## 2022-02-14

**DocFetcher** is now my local file search solution of choice. The file content indexing pushes it ahead of Everything, and FileSeek got kicked to the reject pile.

Created a CSV category under the STEM section, and added Miller and Tad to it. Both are super handy.

## 2022-01-29

Finally added **winget**, **scoop**, and **Patch My PC**, which I've been using for a while now to great success. Sorry Chocolatey!

Also added **Git Extensions**.

## 2021-12-20

Added **Tabby** as a second option under **Windows Terminal**. It's a great app.

Expanded the recommendation for **Transmission**.

Added **OBS Studio**.

## 2021-10-01

**Windows Terminal** dethroned **ConEmu** for my choice of terminal software. I just like it better now. It's simple but still has a robust feature set.

## 2021-09-18

Added **Chrome Remote Desktop** for a remote access solution. Its really simple and requires none of the configuration headaches that come along with VNC.

## 2021-09-17

Added **Obsidian** under note-taking. I've been trying it out for a while, and it definitely does a lot right.

## 2021-07-11

Added **Waveform Free** as an option for a DAW, and mentioned **Ardour** while I was at it.

## 2021-07-05

I switched my VNC pick back to **UltraVNC**. I had dabbled with TigerVNC for a while because it felt a little more lightweight, but UltraVNC is just better for my use cases.

## 2021-06-29

Added a mention of **Pluto** alongside Jupyter.

Updated ConEmu website link.

## 2021-06-15

Migrated site from Wordpress to a simpler system. Now I'm just using pandoc to process Markdown files to HTML, and I'm just hand tweaking some CSS and HTML templates.

## 2021-04-21

Added **Ventoy**. It's a handy tool that was not on my radar until
recently.

Also added a note to the **ShareX** entry that it can do screen capture.
I've been using that feature and it's worth the download just for that
alone.

## 2021-03-11

Added **Microsoft Powertoys** and the **Sysinternals** utilities suites.
I have used both of these for probably close to two decades, and they
are super handy. I'm surprised I haven't added them sooner.

Added **micro** in the text editor section. That's a really cool
up-and-comer in the text editor field. People just aren't learning vi
and emacs anymore (or not like they used to anyway), so I could see
micro becoming the de facto standard editor on Linux someday. A newbie
could open it an do useful things. It will likely eclipse nano quickly.

## 2021-02-28

Added **CopyQ**. I've been trying some clipboard managers, most notably
**Ditto** and CopyQ. I had several bugs and issues with Ditto, and CopyQ
worked out of the box, so it gets the win.

Added **Ninite** as an alternative to Chocolatey. I've used Ninite for
years longer than Chocolatey, and I still use it for niche cases, so it
deserves a mention.

Added **ProduKey**. I've used it a number of times over the years and
it's a lifesaver.  

## 2021-02-20

Added **Mp3tag**. It used to be on the list, but through disuse, I
dropped it. After needing it again for a big music reorganization
project, I figured I'd put it back on the list. It's useful.

## 2021-02-10

Initial version of the website at <https://www.blakesessentials.com>. I
maintained my Essentials list over at my personal website for over 15
years, and I decided to move it to its own domain and convert it to
WordPress mostly just for fun.
