        <h1 id="not-essential">Not Essential</h1>
        <p>So this is just a big, unorganized list of software that I’ve
        tried out, but I just didn’t like it better than other solutions
        that made it to my Essential list. I’m maintaining this list of
        “rejects” just so I can remember if I’ve evaluated a program,
        and what I thought of it. Sometimes I forget why I didn’t like a
        program, and I’m hoping this saves me some time. I started this
        rejects list well after I started my Essentials List, so there’s
        a lot of programs missing, but from now on I’ll add programs as
        I try them.</p>
        <p>So here we go, in no particular order…</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="http://mypaint.org/">MyPaint</a> is a really
        nice digital painting program with a spartan interface. It
        definitely gets the job done, I just like Krita better.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="http://www.bandisoft.com/honeyview/">HoneyView</a> is an
        image viewer with a weird interface. Nothing exciting
        here.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.digikam.org/">digiKam</a> is a photo
        manager/editor. It has RAW processing and some other great
        features, it just isn’t my favorite. I’m keeping my eye on it
        though because it’s actively developed.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> is my media
        server “Plan B” if Plex ever fails me or starts crippling their
        free software. It’s pretty good feature-wise, but the ecosystem
        could use a little polish depending on the platform you’re
        streaming to.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>
        was my go-to ftp/sftp client… and then they started bundling
        their installer with “optional offers” and I accidentally
        installed some adware garbage. I moved on.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="http://dia-installer.de/index.html.en">Dia</a>
        draws vector diagrams. I don’t think it’s better than
        LibreOffice Draw for flowcharts or Inkscape for other
        miscellaneous vector graphics, so it doesn’t make my
        list.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy">Speccy</a> is a
        system information tool. It isn’t really much easier than
        opening the appropriate Windows dialog and getting the same
        information. It just collects it all in one place. Convenient,
        but not essential to me.</p></li>
        <li><p>There are a metric ton of audio players out there,
        including some veterans that have been around for a couple
        decades. Some of the ones I’ve tried that are still viable
        options: <a href="https://www.foobar2000.org/">foobar200</a>, <a
        href="http://www.aimp.ru/">AIMP</a>, <a
        href="http://www.digimezzo.com/software/dopamine/">Dopamine</a>,
        <a href="https://winamp.com/">Winamp</a>, <a
        href="https://www.mediamonkey.com/">MediaMonkey</a>, <a
        href="https://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a>, and <a
        href="https://www.clementine-player.org/">Clementine</a>. They
        all have something to offer, but for my tastes, they don’t come
        out on top.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes</a>
        is a popular computer security software, but I just don’t find
        the free version much better than the virus protection built-in
        to Windows.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.rainmeter.net/">Rainmeter</a> lets
        you skin your desktop with hardware meters and audio
        visualizers. It’s cool, but setup and configuration are
        cumbersome, and at the end of the day… I can’t call it
        <em>essential</em>. It’s a neat toy though.</p></li>
        <li><p>VNC is archaic but useful. I’m recommending
        <strong>UltraVNC</strong>, but some others to try are <a
        href="http://tigervnc.org/">TigerVNC</a>, <a
        href="https://www.tightvnc.com/">TightVNC</a>, and <a
        href="https://turbovnc.org/">TurboVNC</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.gonitro.com/pdf-reader">Nitro PDF
        reader</a> is totally fine. I just don’t see a reason to switch
        to it.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://cmder.net/">cmder</a> is a terminal app
        based on <strong>ConEmu</strong>. It’s pretty, but isn’t
        significantly better than <strong>ConEmu</strong> for now. We’ll
        see how this develops.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacrity</a> is a
        decent terminal emulator, but it really needs a graphical config
        editor.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://www.ccleaner.com/defraggler">Defraggler</a> has a
        free version that optimizes harddisks. I can’t say it’s really
        any better than the tools that come with Windows.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page">Studio</a>
        is a virtual LEGO builder. It is awesome. I can’t say it’s
        essential, but it is a lot of fun.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://brlcad.org/">BRL-CAD</a> is one of the
        CAD programs you hear people recommending to hobbyists
        (especially in Linux circles), but it doesn’t even remotely
        resemble a modern CAD program. It is straight out of 1979…
        literally. I’m not saying it’s bad software, it just shouldn’t
        be recommended as a viable CAD alternative.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://gnucash.org/">GnuCash</a> is a finance
        app. It looks fine, it just isn’t essential to me.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.16software.com/breevy/">Breevy</a> is
        a text expander. It’s cool, but the trial is only 30 days, so
        not free.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://cdex.mu/">CDex</a> was my go-to audio
        converter and CD ripper for years. It suddenly stopped
        development for a while (years?), and I jumped ship. It is back,
        but I can’t find a reason to go back.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.audionodes.com/">AudioNodes</a>
        looks like an interesting multi-track audio editor, but it has
        gotten very little traction in the last few years, so I’m
        skeptical it’s worth my time to learn it. Time will tell if it
        survives. The interface is slick, so I’m keeping my eye on
        it.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/">Filmora</a>
        video editor has a full-featured trial version, but it includes
        a watermark. Good software. Doesn’t really meet my criteria of
        “free” for the purposes of this site.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.screentogif.com/">ScreenToGif</a>
        would be great, but for my use cases, <strong>ShareX</strong>
        already does the job well, so why have a redundant program?
        ScreenToGif does more than just capture a screen recording (it
        does some basic editing too), but I just don’t use those
        features. Someone else might find this essential.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://clonezilla.org/">Clonezilla</a> is a
        fantastic partition/disk cloner. It isn’t on my list only
        because it has stiff competition, and it has more limitations
        than the other guys. The biggest limitations are not supporting
        live (i.e. mounted) filesystems and the destination can’t be
        smaller than the source even if the filesystem contents would
        fit on the smaller partition.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>
        is a great Python IDE. I just don’t find the free version
        (i.e. Community Edition) better than VS Code, and VS Code is
        useful for any number of languages. Heck, I’m writing this
        Markdown in VS Code right now. Nothing against PyCharm, but I’d
        rather learn one tool to handle most of the programming I do. On
        top of that, you have to buy the Professional Edition to get the
        “Scientific Tools” like Notebook and Pandas support, something
        that VS Code has for free. Again, it’s good software, but my
        personal preference is VS Code.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://www.cyberlink.com/downloads/trials/photodirector-photo-editing-software/download_en_US.html?r=1">PhotoDirector
        Essential</a> is basically a ploy to get you to buy
        PhotoDirector 365, which aims to replace both Photoshop and
        Lightroom. It does not. They don’t even make it clear what comes
        with the free Essential version and what are the time-limited
        Premium features that you have to buy after 30 days. I’m happy
        to pay for good software, but don’t pull a bait-and-switch on
        me. Just tell me up front what I’m getting and what I’m
        not.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a> is a
        nice… um, <em>simple</em> note app that works across all
        platforms. It supports Markdown, but otherwise it’s barebones. I
        don’t know what to think about it. It’s not as useful as OneNote
        that can include pictures and whatnot seamlessly with notes, and
        it doesn’t offer a whole lot more than super simple solutions
        like Google Keep or even plain text files synced via Drive or
        Dropbox. It does make syncing automatic though. It’s cool, it
        just doesn’t scratch any itch I have.</p></li>
        <li><p>I don’t use local mail clients for personal use anymore.
        For business I use <strong>Outlook</strong>, but for personal
        use, I use Gmail. If I was going to use a local email client,
        I’d go with the old faithful <a
        href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">Thunderbird</a>.
        Alternatives like the free version of <a
        href="https://getmailspring.com/">Mailspring</a> aren’t
        particularly better.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.messenger.com/desktop">Facebook
        Messenger</a> has a desktop client. It’s fine, but the web app
        at <a href="https://www.messenger.com/">messenger.com</a> works
        just as well for me if I don’t want to use my phone for some
        reason.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> is a
        network traffic analyzer. I used to have this on my essentials
        list when I used to do more IT work. I don’t anymore, and it has
        limited utility to the normal person, so I dropped it. <em>Note:
        it used to be called Ethereal back when I used it
        more.</em></p></li>
        <li><p>I kept hearing about the Git interfaces called <a
        href="https://git-fork.com/">Fork</a> and <a
        href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>. They look
        great, but neither one meets my definition of free due to the
        limitations.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> is
        the predecesor to LibreOffice. After some shenanigans by Oracle,
        LibreOffice was forked from OpenOffice, and it has been the
        better solution ever since.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> was on my
        essential list 10 years ago. Now? Not so much. I’m not really
        looking for an all-in-one chat client now that most chatting is
        done on my phone. At this point, I’m usually using bespoke apps
        like Discord.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="http://nixnote.org/NixNote-Home/">NixNote</a> is
        a note taking app aiming at the Evernote crowd. It is pretty
        basic, no mobile app, and development is stagnated.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.freeoffice.com/">SoftMaker
        FreeOffice</a> has good MS Office file format support, but it is
        a crippled version of their Office Standard and Professional
        versions. You have to upgrade to Standard to get spell-checking
        or ribbon-customization.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> is the best
        open source, local password manager out there. I used it for
        many years. My problem is I really want a cloud solution that
        works on all platforms and browsers seamlessly as I hop from
        device to device. I formerly used KeePass with Dropbox (and
        later Google Drive), but it wasn’t a foolproof, automated
        process that integrated into browsers and everywhere else I use
        it. I eventually switched to <strong>Lastpass</strong> and
        eventually <strong>Bitwarden</strong> as
        <strong>Lastpass</strong> prices climbed.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/">Avidemux</a>
        is a video editor that falls short of its competition. There at
        least four free solutions that are better, maybe more.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://deluge-torrent.org/">Deluge</a> is a
        nice Bittorrent client on Linux, but the releases are way behind
        on Windows and development in general has slowed.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.tixati.com/">Tixati</a> is a
        Bittorrent client. It’s <em>fine</em>, but nothing wows me. Plus
        it’s closed source, which isn’t a feature I like on a Bittorrent
        client.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="http://multicommander.com/">Multi Commander</a>
        is a multi-tabbed file manager. I’ve heard great things about
        it, and it is super-powerful, but it’s just more than I want in
        a file explorer. The interface can be cluttered and overwhelming
        for most tasks. If the learning curve doesn’t scare you off,
        it’s probably amazing. I just end up using a lot of smaller
        tools to accomplish the same tasks (including command line tools
        that I already know).</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/">Ditto</a> is a
        clipboard manager. It’s not bad. It just isn’t better than my
        current favorite, <strong>CopyQ</strong>.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.boxcryptor.com/">BoxCrypter</a> gets
        a lot of mentions on tech blogs and whatnot, but the free
        version is too limited. Namely, it only syncs one cloud provider
        across two devices. I have more than two devices.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/translucenttb/9pf4kz2vn4w9?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab">TranslucentTB</a>
        is cool… but not essential.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> is
        pretty great, but it’s also showing it’s age and just isn’t
        essential for me anymore. Part of the problem for AHK is
        software in general has gotten better, so I just don’t need to
        use it in most applications where I formerly used it.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://medibangpaint.com/en/pc/">MediaBang
        Paint Pro</a> is program for creating digital art and comics.
        It’s pretty specific, and I don’t think it’s better than Krita.
        Not to mention MediaBang has ads while Krita is
        ad-free.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://calligra.org/">Calligra</a> is KDE’s
        office suite. The interface lacks polish (widgets being cramped
        or labels being cut off) and it really doesn’t do anything
        better than LibreOffice.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="http://www.xyntec.com/unit-converter-download.htm">Converber</a>
        is a decent unit converter, but having to select the unit from a
        list (instead of typing) is cumbersome.</p></li>
        <li><p><a
        href="https://www.2brightsparks.com/freeware/freeware-hub.html">SyncBackFree</a>
        was my file backup choice for many years, but the alternatives
        eventually surpassed it for my uses.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="http://www.pspad.com/en/">PSPad</a> was briefly
        my text editor of choice 20 years ago (maybe 2002 or so?), and
        while it is still maintained, the UI is just badly dated.
        Looking at it today it looks like a cluttered mess.</p></li>
