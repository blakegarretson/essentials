# Not Essential

So this is just a big, unorganized list of software that I've tried out, but I just didn't like it better than other solutions that made it to my Essential list. I'm maintaining this list of "rejects" just so I can remember if I've evaluated a program, and what I thought of it. Sometimes I forget why I didn't like a program, and I'm hoping this saves me some time. I just started this rejects list recently, so there's a lot of programs missing, but from now on I'll add programs as I try them.

So here we go, in no particular order...

- [FastStone Image Viewer](https://www.faststone.org/FSViewerDetail.htm) is a fantastic photo viewer with a truly impressive set of editing features. After Google retired their Picasa software I used FastStone for about a year, but I just couldn't get on board with the unintuitive interface, and I ended up switching to something else.

- [MyPaint](http://mypaint.org/) is a really nice digital painting program with a spartan interface. It definitely gets the job done, I just like Krita better.

- [HoneyView](http://www.bandisoft.com/honeyview/) is an image viewer with a weird interface. Nothing exciting here.

- [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/) is a photo manager/editor. It has RAW processing and some other great features, it just isn't my favorite. I'm keeping my eye on it though because it's actively developed.

- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) is my media server "Plan B" if Plex ever fails me or starts crippling their free software. It's pretty good feature-wise, but the ecosystem could use a little polish depending on the platform you're streaming to.

- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) was my go-to ftp/sftp client... and then they started bundling their installer with "optional offers" and I accidentally installed some adware garbage. I moved on.

- [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) is a system information tool. It isn't really much easier than opening the appropriate Windows dialog and getting the same information. It just collects it all in one place. Convenient, but not essential to me.

- There are a metric ton of audio players out there, including some veterans that have been around for a couple decades. Some of the ones I've tried that are still viable options: [foobar200](https://www.foobar2000.org/), [AIMP](http://www.aimp.ru/), [Winamp](https://winamp.com/), [MediaMonkey](https://www.mediamonkey.com/), and [Clementine](https://www.clementine-player.org/). They all have something to offer, but for my tastes, they don't come out on top.

- [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) is a popular computer security software, but I just don't find the free version much better than the virus protection built-in to Windows.

- [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) lets you skin your desktop with hardware meters and audio visualizers. It's cool, but setup and configuration are cumbersome, and at the end of the day... I can't call it *essential*. It's a neat toy though.

- [Defraggler](https://www.ccleaner.com/defraggler) has a free version that optimizes harddisks. I can't say it's really any better than the tools that come with Windows.

- [Breevy](http://www.16software.com/breevy/) is a text expander. It's cool, but the trial is only 30 days, so not free.

- [Filmora](https://filmora.wondershare.com/) video editor has a full-featured trial version, but it includes a watermark. Good software. Doesn't really meet my criteria of "free" for the purposes of this site.

- [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) would be great, but for my use cases, **ShareX** already does the job well, so why have a redundant program? ScreenToGif does more than just capture a screen recording (it does some basic editing too), but I just don't use those features. Someone else might find this essential.
  
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a great Python IDE. I just don't find the free version (i.e. Community Edition) better than VS Code, and VS Code is useful for any number of languages. Heck, I'm writing this Markdown in VS Code right now. Nothing against PyCharm, but I'd rather learn one tool to handle most of the programming I do. On top of that, you have to buy the Professional Edition to get the "Scientific Tools" like Notebook and Pandas support, something that VS Code has for free. Again, it's good software, but my personal preference is VS Code.

- [PhotoDirector Essential](https://www.cyberlink.com/downloads/trials/photodirector-photo-editing-software/download_en_US.html?r=1) is basically a ploy to get you to buy PhotoDirector 365, which aims to replace both Photoshop and Lightroom. It does not. They don't even make it clear what comes with the free Essential version and what are the time-limited Premium features that you have to buy after 30 days. I'm happy to pay for good software, but don't pull a bait-and-switch on me. Just tell me up front what I'm getting and what I'm not.

- [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) is a nice Bittorrent client on Linux, but the releases are way behind on Windows and development in general has slowed.

- [Tixati](https://www.tixati.com/) is a Bittorrent client. It's *fine*, but nothing wows me. Plus it's closed source, which isn't a feature I like on a Bittorrent client.

- [Multi Commander](http://multicommander.com/) is a multi-tabbed file manager. I've heard great things about it, and it is super-powerful, but it's just more than I want in a file explorer. The interface can be cluttered and overwhelming for most tasks. If the learning curve doesn't scare you off, it's probably amazing. I just end up using a lot of smaller tools to accomplish the same tasks (including command line tools that I already know).

- [Ditto](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/) is a clipboard manager. It's not bad. It just isn't better than my current favorite, **CopyQ**.

- [BoxCrypter](https://www.boxcryptor.com/) gets a lot of mentions on tech blogs and whatnot, but the free version is too limited. Namely, it only syncs one cloud provider across two devices. I have more than two devices.

- [TranslucentTB](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/translucenttb/9pf4kz2vn4w9?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab) is cool... but not essential.

- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is pretty great, but it's also showing it's age and just isn't essential for me anymore. Part of the problem for AHK is software in general has gotten better, so I just don't need to use it in most applications where I formerly used it.

- [MediaBang Paint Pro](https://medibangpaint.com/en/pc/) is program for creating digital art and comics. It's pretty specific, and I don't think it's better than Krita. Not to mention MediaBang has ads while Krita is ad-free.

- [Autodesk Sketchbook](https://www.autodesk.com/products/sketchbook/overview) is now free apparently. It is excellent, but it has a checkered past as "free" software. It was _sort of_ free, but with limitations, and then it seems they released it for free for real this time, but I'm not sure I trust them to keep it free. I just don't want to invest the time in learning a program, saving a lot of files in their proprietary format, and then they yank the rug out. Autodesk has done that before, so I'm leery. Other than that, it's great software... but so is Krita.
