# Not Essential

So this is just a big, unorganized list of software that I've tried out, but I just didn't like it better than other solutions that made it to my Essential list. I'm maintaining this list of "rejects" just so I can remember if I've evaluated a program, and what I thought of it. Sometimes I forget why I didn't like a program, and I'm hoping this this saves me some time.

So here we go, in no particular order...

- [MediaBang Paint Pro](https://medibangpaint.com/en/pc/) is program for creating digital art and comics. It's pretty specific, and I don't think it's better than Krita. Not to mention MediaBang has ads while Krita is ad-free.

- [Autodesk Sketchbook](https://www.autodesk.com/products/sketchbook/overview) is now free apparently. It is excellent, but it has a checkered past as "free" software. It was _sort of_ free, but with limitations, and then it seems they released it for free for real this time, but I'm not sure I trust them to keep it free. I just don't want to invest the time in learning a program, saving a lot of files in their proprietary format, and then they yank the rug out. Autodesk has done that before, so I'm leery. Other than that, it's great software... but so is Krita.
