# Not Essential

So this is just a big, unorganized list of software that I've tried out, but I just didn't like it better than other solutions that made it to my Essential list. I'm maintaining this list of "rejects" just so I can remember if I've evaluated a program, and what I thought of it. Sometimes I forget why I didn't like a program, and I'm hoping this saves me some time. I started this rejects list well after I started my Essentials List, so there's a lot of programs missing, but from now on I'll add programs as I try them.

So here we go, in no particular order...

- [MyPaint](http://mypaint.org/) is a really nice digital painting program with a spartan interface. It definitely gets the job done, I just like Krita better.

- [HoneyView](http://www.bandisoft.com/honeyview/) is an image viewer with a weird interface. Nothing exciting here.

- [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/) is a photo manager/editor. It has RAW processing and some other great features, it just isn't my favorite. I'm keeping my eye on it though because it's actively developed.

- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) is my media server "Plan B" if Plex ever fails me or starts crippling their free software. It's pretty good feature-wise, but the ecosystem could use a little polish depending on the platform you're streaming to.

- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) was my go-to ftp/sftp client... and then they started bundling their installer with "optional offers" and I accidentally installed some adware garbage. I moved on.

- [Dia](http://dia-installer.de/index.html.en) draws vector diagrams. I don't think it's better than LibreOffice Draw for flowcharts or Inkscape for other miscellaneous vector graphics, so it doesn't make my list.

- [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) is a system information tool. It isn't really much easier than opening the appropriate Windows dialog and getting the same information. It just collects it all in one place. Convenient, but not essential to me.

- There are a metric ton of audio players out there, including some veterans that have been around for a couple decades. Some of the ones I've tried that are still viable options: [foobar200](https://www.foobar2000.org/), [AIMP](http://www.aimp.ru/), [Dopamine](http://www.digimezzo.com/software/dopamine/), [Winamp](https://winamp.com/), [MediaMonkey](https://www.mediamonkey.com/), [Amarok](https://amarok.kde.org/), and [Clementine](https://www.clementine-player.org/). They all have something to offer, but for my tastes, they don't come out on top.

- [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) is a popular computer security software, but I just don't find the free version much better than the virus protection built-in to Windows.

- [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) lets you skin your desktop with hardware meters and audio visualizers. It's cool, but setup and configuration are cumbersome, and at the end of the day... I can't call it *essential*. It's a neat toy though.

- VNC is archaic but useful. I'm recommending **UltraVNC**, but some others to try are [TigerVNC](http://tigervnc.org/), [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/), and [TurboVNC](https://turbovnc.org/).

- [Nitro PDF reader](https://www.gonitro.com/pdf-reader) is totally fine. I just don't see a reason to switch to it.

- [cmder](https://cmder.net/) is a terminal app based on **ConEmu**. It's pretty, but isn't significantly better than **ConEmu** for now. We'll see how this develops.

- [Alacrity](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is a decent terminal emulator, but it really needs a graphical config editor.

- [Defraggler](https://www.ccleaner.com/defraggler) has a free version that optimizes harddisks. I can't say it's really any better than the tools that come with Windows.

- [Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page) is a virtual LEGO builder. It is awesome. I can't say it's essential, but it is a lot of fun.

- [BRL-CAD](https://brlcad.org/) is one of the CAD programs you hear people recommending to hobbyists (especially in Linux circles), but it doesn't even remotely resemble a modern CAD program. It is straight out of 1979... literally. I'm not saying it's bad software, it just shouldn't be recommended as a viable CAD alternative.

- [GnuCash](https://gnucash.org/) is a finance app. It looks fine, it just isn't essential to me.

- [Breevy](http://www.16software.com/breevy/) is a text expander. It's cool, but the trial is only 30 days, so not free.

- [CDex](https://cdex.mu/) was my go-to audio converter and CD ripper for years. It suddenly stopped development for a while (years?), and I jumped ship. It is back, but I can't find a reason to go back.

- [AudioNodes](https://www.audionodes.com/) looks like an interesting multi-track audio editor, but it has gotten very little traction in the last few years, so I'm skeptical it's worth my time to learn it. Time will tell if it survives. The interface is slick, so I'm keeping my eye on it.

- [Filmora](https://filmora.wondershare.com/) video editor has a full-featured trial version, but it includes a watermark. Good software. Doesn't really meet my criteria of "free" for the purposes of this site.

- [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) would be great, but for my use cases, **ShareX** already does the job well, so why have a redundant program? ScreenToGif does more than just capture a screen recording (it does some basic editing too), but I just don't use those features. Someone else might find this essential.
  
- [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/) is a fantastic partition/disk cloner. It isn't on my list only because it has stiff competition, and it has more limitations than the other guys. The biggest limitations are not supporting live (i.e. mounted) filesystems and the destination can't be smaller than the source even if the filesystem contents would fit on the smaller partition.

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a great Python IDE. I just don't find the free version (i.e. Community Edition) better than VS Code, and VS Code is useful for any number of languages. Heck, I'm writing this Markdown in VS Code right now. Nothing against PyCharm, but I'd rather learn one tool to handle most of the programming I do. On top of that, you have to buy the Professional Edition to get the "Scientific Tools" like Notebook and Pandas support, something that VS Code has for free. Again, it's good software, but my personal preference is VS Code.

- [PhotoDirector Essential](https://www.cyberlink.com/downloads/trials/photodirector-photo-editing-software/download_en_US.html?r=1) is basically a ploy to get you to buy PhotoDirector 365, which aims to replace both Photoshop and Lightroom. It does not. They don't even make it clear what comes with the free Essential version and what are the time-limited Premium features that you have to buy after 30 days. I'm happy to pay for good software, but don't pull a bait-and-switch on me. Just tell me up front what I'm getting and what I'm not.

- [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) is a nice... um, *simple* note app that works across all platforms. It supports Markdown, but otherwise it's barebones. I don't know what to think about it. It's not as useful as OneNote that can include pictures and whatnot seamlessly with notes, and it doesn't offer a whole lot more than super simple solutions like Google Keep or even plain text files synced via Drive or Dropbox. It does make syncing automatic though. It's cool, it just doesn't scratch any itch I have.

- I don't use local mail clients for personal use anymore. For business I use **Outlook**, but for personal use, I use Gmail. If I was going to use a local email client, I'd go with the old faithful [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/). Alternatives like the free version of [Mailspring](https://getmailspring.com/) aren't particularly better.

- [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/desktop) has a desktop client. It's fine, but the web app at [messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com/) works just as well for me if I don't want to use my phone for some reason.

- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is a network traffic analyzer. I used to have this on my essentials list when I used to do more IT work. I don't anymore, and it has limited utility to the normal person, so I dropped it. *Note: it used to be called Ethereal back when I used it more.*

- I kept hearing about the Git interfaces called [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) and [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). They look great, but neither one meets my definition of free due to the limitations.

- [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) is the predecesor to LibreOffice. After some shenanigans by Oracle, LibreOffice was forked from OpenOffice, and it has been the better solution ever since.

- [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) was on my essential list 10 years ago. Now? Not so much. I'm not really looking for an all-in-one chat client now that most chatting is done on my phone. At this point, I'm usually using bespoke apps like Discord.

- [NixNote](http://nixnote.org/NixNote-Home/) is a note taking app aiming at the Evernote crowd. It is pretty basic, no mobile app, and development is stagnated.

- [SoftMaker FreeOffice](https://www.freeoffice.com/) has good MS Office file format support, but it is a crippled version of their Office Standard and Professional versions. You have to upgrade to Standard to get spell-checking or ribbon-customization.

- [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) is the best open source, local password manager out there. I used it for many years. My problem is I really want a cloud solution that works on all platforms and browsers seamlessly as I hop from device to device. I formerly used KeePass with Dropbox (and later Google Drive), but it wasn't a foolproof, automated process that integrated into browsers and everywhere else I use it. I eventually switched to **Lastpass** and eventually **Bitwarden** as **Lastpass** prices climbed.

- [Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/) is a video editor that falls short of its competition. There at least four free solutions that are better, maybe more.

- [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) is a nice Bittorrent client on Linux, but the releases are way behind on Windows and development in general has slowed.

- [Tixati](https://www.tixati.com/) is a Bittorrent client. It's *fine*, but nothing wows me. Plus it's closed source, which isn't a feature I like on a Bittorrent client.

- [Multi Commander](http://multicommander.com/) is a multi-tabbed file manager. I've heard great things about it, and it is super-powerful, but it's just more than I want in a file explorer. The interface can be cluttered and overwhelming for most tasks. If the learning curve doesn't scare you off, it's probably amazing. I just end up using a lot of smaller tools to accomplish the same tasks (including command line tools that I already know).

- [Ditto](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/) is a clipboard manager. It's not bad. It just isn't better than my current favorite, **CopyQ**.

- [BoxCrypter](https://www.boxcryptor.com/) gets a lot of mentions on tech blogs and whatnot, but the free version is too limited. Namely, it only syncs one cloud provider across two devices. I have more than two devices.

- [TranslucentTB](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/translucenttb/9pf4kz2vn4w9?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab) is cool... but not essential.

- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is pretty great, but it's also showing it's age and just isn't essential for me anymore. Part of the problem for AHK is software in general has gotten better, so I just don't need to use it in most applications where I formerly used it.

- [MediaBang Paint Pro](https://medibangpaint.com/en/pc/) is program for creating digital art and comics. It's pretty specific, and I don't think it's better than Krita. Not to mention MediaBang has ads while Krita is ad-free.

- [Calligra](https://calligra.org/) is KDE's office suite. The interface lacks polish (widgets being cramped or labels being cut off) and it really doesn't do anything better than LibreOffice.

- [Converber](http://www.xyntec.com/unit-converter-download.htm) is a decent unit converter, but having to select the unit from a list (instead of typing) is cumbersome.

- [SyncBackFree](https://www.2brightsparks.com/freeware/freeware-hub.html) was my file backup choice for many years, but the alternatives eventually surpassed it for my uses.

- [PSPad](http://www.pspad.com/en/) was briefly my text editor of choice 20 years ago (maybe 2002 or so?), and while it is still maintained, the UI is just badly dated. Looking at it today it looks like a cluttered mess.
